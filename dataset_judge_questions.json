        "0": "Thank you very much. This is a question to both parties, please. Having read the file and various submissions by the parties, I still don't exactly picture how the person at the material time, the applicant, moved in the prison. So I really would like to have a better understanding. I assume that after having breakfast and having cleaned whatever he had to clean, was he, was the cell door open and he could leave wherever he wanted? And then, assuming that this is the case, where was he able to go? I understand that there is a courtyard. There are some gym-like facilities. But I don't, assuming that the same applies to all other inmates, how many of them are at the same time playing basketball, reading in the library? I just don't understand because I don't have a full picture. So if you could explain to me or to us what actually happens, how many people are there at the same time, what happens if it's raining? So all of them have to leave the courtyard, and so on and so forth. It would be extremely helpful to understand whether really he is not all the time, as the applicant's lawyer claims, is locked up. So even if he's not locked up, I don't understand what exactly happens to him if he wishes to go one place or another within the prison. And what is the size of those places compared to the number of all the inmates wishing to do the same thing he might wish? Thank you.",
        "1": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is addressed to the government. According to Croatian law, and I refer to Section 74 of the Enforcement of Prison Sentences Act, there shall be a minimum space of four square meters and 10 cubic meters per prisoner in each dormitory. This looks like to me as an absolute minimum approach to the size of the available space to each prisoner. Now, my question to the government is the following. How can the government today defend before this court a flexible overall approach, a flexible overall standard, which is not only contradictory vis-a-vis the national law, but also with the CPT standards to which the government itself has referred to? Thank you very much.",
        "2": "A very brief question to both parties. It's in average, how many hours a day is the prisoner locked up in his cell? I mean, you can give me a figure. Thank you.",
        "3": "Thank you, Mr. President. As the parties are aware, this case was relinquished to the Grand Chamber, so the convention stipulates that we are dealing with a serious question affecting the interpretation of the convention and is on that basis, and due to some of the arguments made here today, that I would like to pose a question, mainly to the applicants, but I would like, with the permission of the president, to ask the government and the third-party intervener to maybe comment. There was some notion or suggestion here that we, in examining the applicability issue, should look at the implications, the possible consequences of that approach, and that issue is not dealt with directly by the applicants in their brief, so that's why I put forward the question. And I would like to focus here on what the applicants consider to be the possible consequences of that approach in the following terms. We see that freedom of information legislation sometimes provides, or often provides, for absolute limitations under domestic law. In certain circumstances, there simply is not a document, for example, dealing with national security issues, law enforcement issues, they are simply excluded from the domestic right. How would the applicants invite the court to deal with those types of situation, assuming that there is a right under Article 10, and thus, in general, Article 10 would necessitate a proportionality-type analysis? How would we, the court, be able to deal with those kinds of situations in particular? And on that note as well, would the court, assuming that such a right would be recognized, what about notions such as what constitutes a public authority, a quasi-public authority, an official document? Would these kinds of notions have to be autonomously interpreted by the court, or do you foresee a possible different way the court could proceed on that basis? My second question is linked to an argument made by the applicants here today. They invite us to look at, the court to look at, other international instruments and decisions. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the UN Human Rights Committee, if I'm not mistaken, the provisions they are dealing with explicitly mention a right to seek information, which, as you know, Article 10 does not. Can the applicants confront that issue in particular, and could they tell the court, are there any examples either in international norms, or even in constitutional norms, where the right of access to documents has been considered an inherent rule in a similar textual formulation like Article 10 of the Convention? Thank you.",
        "4": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My question is mainly addressed to the government, but it is also open to the applicants if they wish to comment. According to Article 31, Paragraph 3C of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the court must take into account any relevant rules and principles of international law applicable in the relations between the contracting parties, in our case, Hungary. As you know, this provision has been repeatedly invoked and applied by our court as an important rule of interpretation of the European Convention of Human Rights. The UK government has correctly referred to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. Now, Hungary is bound by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, whose Article 19 explicitly recognized the right to seek information. Hungary has also ratified the Council of Europe Convention on access to official documents. Furthermore, Hungary is a member of the EU whose Charter of Fundamental Rights and relevant 2001 regulation recognized the right of access to documents of the EU institutions. So in view of those apparently relevant rules and principles of international and European law binding upon or accepted by Hungary, how do you see the functioning of Article 31, paragraph C, of the Vienna Convention in the present case? Thank you very much.",

Et on conna\u00eet aussi que l'interpr\u00e9tation des droits de l'homme, des trait\u00e9s des droits de l'homme, des trait\u00e9s multilat\u00e9raux des droits de l'homme, est diff\u00e9rente par rapport aux trait\u00e9s qui ne sont pas, qui ne concernent pas les droits de l'homme, vu que dans les trait\u00e9s des droits de l'homme, la question de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9 ne s'applique pas. Donc, normalement, on dit dans la doctrine que dans les trait\u00e9s des droits de l'homme, on n'a pas le m\u00eame type d'interpr\u00e9tation vu le fait que les intentions des partis, et ici je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux travaux pr\u00e9paratoires dont le gouvernement britannique a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, ne jouent pas le m\u00eame r\u00f4le comme ils jouent dans les trait\u00e9s bilat\u00e9raux ou les trait\u00e9s multilat\u00e9raux qui ne traitent pas les droits de l'homme. Donc voil\u00e0 une question qui est reconnue dans la doctrine et qui fait la diff\u00e9rence entre les deux types d'interpr\u00e9tation dans les trait\u00e9s multilat\u00e9raux qui traitent les droits de l'homme et dans les trait\u00e9s multilat\u00e9raux qui ne traitent pas les droits de l'homme. Et en relation avec cette question, je voulais poser une question plus concr\u00e8te au gouvernement hongrois parce que dans le paragraphe 11 de votre m\u00e9moire, le gouvernement hongrois se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au fait que dans l'affaire Taraschuk, ils n'\u00e9taient pas capables de contester l'applicabilit\u00e9 de l'article 10 vu qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas partis dans l'affaire Mackey contre la R\u00e9publique tch\u00e8que. Mais comme on reconna\u00eet dans la doctrine et comme le Lord Brown l'avait expliqu\u00e9 dans l'affaire Sugar, on regarde ces trois affaires, \u00e7a veut dire l'affaire Mackey, l'affaire Taraschuk et l'affaire Kennedy, comme une trilogie de notre cours, \u00e7a veut dire trois affaires qui reconnaissent d'une mani\u00e8re progressive ce type de droit. Et ma question au gouvernement hongrois est la suivante. Est-ce qu'au moment o\u00f9 l'affaire Taraschuk \u00e9tait devant le gouvernement hongrois, pourquoi est l'affaire Mackey pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente \u00e0 l'affaire Taraschuk de l'ann\u00e9e 2006, pourquoi est-ce qu'en ce moment-l\u00e0, le gouvernement hongrois n'a pas contest\u00e9 comme il le fait aujourd'hui l'applicabilit\u00e9 de l'article 10 \u00e0 ce genre de question? La deuxi\u00e8me question que je pose au gouvernement hongrois et qui est plus concr\u00e8te et qui vise aussi l'article 31, le paragraphe 3, se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au droit de l'Union europ\u00e9enne. Et le gouvernement hongrois donne plusieurs exemples du droit de l'Union europ\u00e9enne concernant la protection des donn\u00e9es, mais ils ne font pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, par exemple, \u00e0 une affaire qui est tr\u00e8s importante pour le droit de l'Union europ\u00e9enne, notamment pour l'article 8 de la charte des droits fondamentaux, \u00e7a veut dire \u00ab austerite contre le Randfund \u00bb o\u00f9 on sait qu'il y avait un acc\u00e8s concernant les donn\u00e9es qui \u00e9taient plus priv\u00e9es concernant les salaires vu que le requ\u00e9rant demandait un contr\u00f4le de d\u00e9pense publique. Donc, quelle est la position du gouvernement hongrois par rapport \u00e0 cette jurisprudence de la Cour de Luxembourg et par rapport au fait que la Hongrie est membre de l'Union europ\u00e9enne et qu'elle est soumise aux dispositions et aux sources du droit europ\u00e9en? Je vous remercie beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "6": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question goes, first of all, to the representatives of the government, but of course, the applicants can also comment on it. And the question relates to \u2014 it's a factual question. It relates to a broader context of the applicant situation. Most of the police departments provided the information to the applicant, which the applicant requested. However, a couple of departments refused to provide it, and that's why we have the case here. And the basis for that, according to the interpretation, was that the information contained private data which cannot be disclosed under the domestic law. That's what the government defended, this position. I have a question which then splits into probably four questions, and I will now tell all of them in certain consequence. First of all, are there any provisions, and if so, what provisions in the Hungarian domestic law regarding liability for disclosure by public officials of information which is not to \u2014 which cannot be disclosed under the domestic law, which is protected, such information as private data? Second, if the answer to this first question is in the positive, that such provisions exist, and I believe that they must exist, then have these provisions been applied to any public official, any police department that disclosed the information which was requested by the applicant? My third question is, if the answer to this question is no, if it is in the negative, then why they have not been applied, if they have not been applied? And the fourth question, or the fourth part of this big question is, if they have not been applied because persons concerned have not initiated this application, still, have there been any ex post facto \u2014 I mean ex post facto, that is, after the final judgment of the Supreme Court \u2014 instructions by the executive or by whichever authority to the police departments that they should not disclose such information in the future if such information is requested? Thank you.",
        "7": "Thank you, Mr. President. The question is addressed to the government, but the applicants are free to react to this question. Government refer to the continuous legal relationship inherent in this type of welfare or pension schemes. Now, I would like to ask two questions, factual questions related to this. First, assuming that Act 191 of 2011 does not exist, did not enter into force, would the applicant be eligible on the basis of her medical condition as established in 2012, although she was not a recipient of benefits at that point of time? So once again, the hypothetical is, without the new law under the old system, was would have been a possibility to provide her benefit. The second question is somewhat similar to this one. There was a change in 2014 regarding the years in service which are to be taken into consideration. Those, to some extent, if I may call them, are more favorable. The applicant, nevertheless, if I understand correctly, was still not eligible. Now, assume that someone in her situation, that is to say, denied of the benefit in 2012, but satisfying the new conditions of 2014, would that person be eligible to be a recipient of the benefit from 2014 onwards? Thank you.",
        "8": "Thank you very much, President. I would have first two questions to the applicants. My first question is the withdrawal of the disability pension as of 1st February 2010 was brought to the labor court, which decided on 1st April 2011. And as I understand, the case was not brought further to any other Hungarian court or the Hungarian Constitutional Court nor to the European Court of Human Rights. And I would just like why. And my second question is on what financial means did the applicant live after the withdrawal as of 1st February 2010? And if she had no financial means as a basis for existence, why was the case not argued under Article 3? My other three questions are of quite a technical nature and more addressed to the government. So in as far as the applicant has contributed to the disability pension, is there a specific contribution to disability pension or covers it both disability and old age pension? Or is there a differentiation? And the next question is, if the pension had not been withdrawn, would it be transferred, the disability pension, into an old age pension at a certain moment? And if yes, when? And last question, if she now, is she still eligible to get an old age pension or is she excluded from the possibility of having an old age pension as well? Thank you.",
        "9": "Thank you. Well, as far as it could have any relevance for the assessment of the case by this court, could the applicant give us some information on the medical or clinical reasons for the disability of the applicant? Of course, I'm not asking for any details, but just some general information of the reason for the impairment of the applicant, which made him unable to work. Thank you.",
        "10": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions, both to the government and to the applicant. The first question is the following. Was the applicant, after the withdrawal of her disability pension, eligible to receive any types of benefits or allowances under the Hungarian law? Did the applicant apply for such benefits or no? And the second question, I would like to know the exact amount of the disability pension which was granted, if I remember correctly, in 2001. What was the amount at that time, and what was the amount of that disability pension at the time it was withdrawn? Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.",
        "11": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. It's a bit of a question in line of what my colleague just asked, but a very precise question. When the pension allowance was withdrawn in 2010, did the applicant at that moment receive a rehabilitation allowance? Some uncertainty in the facts. I'm asking that because if she had received a rehabilitation allowance, which I understand is of a lower amount than the pension allowance, than a disability pension, then she might benefit from a transitional rule in the act of 2011. So a very precise question about the disability allowance, whether she received it or not.",
        "12": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My first question goes to the applicant. And I would like to ask you, in the light of what you had said at the beginning, how you take into account the recent resolution of the Security Council, 2249, adopted recently, a few days ago, which considers, again, that terrorism is a threat to the peace and security. And this is not the first time that the Security Councils have qualified terrorism as such. How you take into account this resolution of the Security Council in relation with Article 103 of the Charter of the UN and in relation with Article 6 in our convention as such? My second question is also to the applicant. And I would like to see, because you have invoked the U.N. Directive, I would like to have your interpretation of you about the Article 12 of this directive, which, now, it's not very clear for a lot of the doctrine, and especially to the reference in the Article 12 to the Article 3, Paragraph 6 of this directive. My third question, it's addressed to the government of the UK. And I would like the government of the UK to comment in the Paragraph 39 of the Supreme Court of Judication, Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, which said, in this type of cases, the court is only likely to conclude that there have been an abusive process if a defendant can establish that there have been an unequivocal representation of those responsible for the conduct of the prosecution and the defendant has acted in this statement. And I would like to see what means for this court to be unequivocal, where he was not aware that he became a suspect because he was called to be a witness. Thank you very much, Mr. President.",
        "13": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have one question for the Council for the first three applicants, and then two questions for the government that have been provoked by the pleadings here today. I noticed that in the pleadings of the Council for the first three applicants, there was no direct pleadings or reference to whether compelling reasons existed for restricting the first three applicants' rights to legal advice. Do I understand it to be the case that the Council stipulates that there were compelling reasons to restrict advice of the first three applicants, or is it the contention of the Council that it really doesn't matter for the legal assessment whether compelling reasons existed or not, as an overall fairness assessment needs to be considered? Or does it need to be conducted anyways? Could I just get a clarification from the Council on that issue? And may I, as the Council referred to international legal instruments and the EU position, may I ask Council to take into account in their answer Article 3 of the directive just mentioned by Judge Motok, the directive of 2013 of the right of access to a lawyer, where in Article 3 there is an explicit exception provided to the right of access to a lawyer when the government, the police, are confronted with adverse consequences or an urgent need to protect life and liberty? To the government, may I firstly ask a clarification on a factual issue? There is a distinction in the facts as regards the way in which the decision was taken in restricting legal advice of the first three applicants, in the sense that that decision in all the first three applicants' cases was explicitly reasoned and recorded. So we have information in the file on the actual thinking behind the decision to restrict legal advice. However, in the fourth applicant's case, there is no such recording or reasoning given at the time when the decision was taken. May I ask, was the fact that this decision was not recorded or reasoned, is that an anomaly under UK criminal procedural law or guidelines or codes? And if this is not an anomaly, is there a basis for an exceptions to recording or reasoning for procedural decisions of that nature? The second question is a linked question. I understand the government to rely heavily on the fact that under domestic law, Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act, there is an explicit statutory regime regulating when restrictions on legal advice can take place. Now, in the fourth applicant's case, as I understand it, there was an explicit decision taken not to caution. Is it the government's contention that the superintendent who decided, who made that decision at that moment, also in the individual circumstances, made an assessment on whether the conditions under Schedule 8 for restricting legal advice, not just the breach of the code on the right to remain silent, but he also made a determination which the government has emphasized is part of the assessment of compelling reasons, also made a determination under Schedule 8 of the Terrorism Act. And the reason I ask is because we do not have any record or reasoning given for that decision. Thank you very much, Mr. President.",
        "14": "Thank you, Mr. President. My questions are addressed primarily to the government, but the applicants' lawyers are free to comment if they wish so. I had a difficulty following your argument, so this is just for clarification. Is it the position of the government that the compelling reasons are to be determined at the level of domestic proceedings, or is it within the power of this court to analyze compelling reasons? Or would it be, in your view, an act of force instance? Related to this, and I apologize for asking this, but I was forced by arguments made by applicants. In paragraph 38 of the applicants, Ibrahim and others' observations to the court, there is a discussion of the presence or availability of lawyers before and during the safety interview. If I understand you correctly, your argument is that this situation was extraordinary, and I think no one can doubt that. But then you also mentioned that it is obvious why these interviews were taken in the absence of lawyers who were, at least in some cases, available. And sometimes even the obvious needs some explanation. So I would be very grateful if you were kind enough to explain what is the interest that necessitates the absence of lawyers in those circumstances and in the particular circumstances of this case. My second question is related to a case, and I apologize if my pronunciation is not correct. Maggie, or Maggie, this is a case we decided in 2000. This is a Northern Ireland terrorist case. The facts, as far as I can see, are comparable. There, one of the reasons for finding a violation was that holding the applicant incommunicado for around 48 hours in appalling conditions amounted to coercion. Now, I wonder whether you would like to distinguish the present situation from that one, and if so, on which ground. I understand that the period is shorter, but these facts were not presented by you so far. In regard to Maggie, finally, and obviously related to Maggie, there was no discussion of the problem of self-incrimination. And related to it, the problem of remaining silent. I would like to know the position of the government. What is the place of the rule against self-incrimination in the convention? Do you consider this to be, because it's not there. And there was argument recently in this auditorium, if I may call this chamber an auditorium, where it was argued that the absence of certain words which are in the Universal Declaration and in the covenant being absent from the convention mean that there is an intention not to include it. And we know that these considerations, self-incrimination, et cetera, are not in the text. So what is the place of those principles or rules according to the government from the perspective of Article VI? Thank you very much.",
        "15": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to ask both parties whether they can assist the court in the interpretation of the famous paragraph 55 of the Saldus judgment. It is said there that even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction, whatever its justification, must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under Article 6. And then the next sentence reads, the rights of the defense will in principle, and I stress in principle, be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction. This seems to suggest that apart from the principle, there is also an exception. I would like to ask whether the applicants agree with this part of the Saldus principles, including the in principle term. I know from the government that they agree with the fact that there is a principle and therefore also an exception, so I'm not going to ask them the question. But then I would like to ask both parties whether they can give examples. In the first place, and that would then be especially for the applicants, what could be exceptions where the use of statements made without the assistance of a lawyer would not violate the overall fairness? But the government can reply to that too. And then vice versa, especially for the government, but the applicants can also give an answer, when would such use violate the overall fairness, also taking into account that according to Saldus, this is what usually as a matter of principle would happen. So I'm asking for some clear examples because a lot has been said, but it's for me not clear how you look at the application of this last part of the Saldus principles in practice. Thank you.",
        "16": "Thank you very much. Just a brief question to the government. As I understand, the three first applicants were cautious about their rights in several ways, but there was a caution given to them. However, the fourth applicant was not cautious. I mean, no warning was given to him. Now, the question is, well, the government seems to maintain that there were compelling reasons for not cautioning the fourth applicant. However, I would like to some explanation why the government considered there were not compelling reasons for not cautioning the three first one, but there were compelling reasons for not cautioning the fourth one. What was the difference between the three first applicant and the fourth applicant in this respect? Thank you.",
        "17": "Thank you, Mr. President. The question is put to the government but can also be dealt with by the applicant. I looked for the position of the UK government on the Internet this morning, and the UK government has a webpage where the issue of the types of prison sentences is clarified. And I quote from that page on the web, All life term means there is no minimum term set by the judge and the person is never considered for release. This is the position of the UK government on the Internet. The page was last updated on the 12th of November 2014. I also looked at the official position of the Sentencing Council for England and Wales and the same statement is made there. I also looked for the official position of the Law Commission and the same statement is there to be found. In none of these sites is there reference to Bieber or Newell. My question is what is the official position of the UK government? Is this clear enough for the UK citizens and for the outside world? How can the UK government clarify this discrepancy between what is on the Internet in these various sources and the position that was presented today to the court? Thank you very much.",
        "18": "I would very much appreciate to learn about the legal nature of the LIFE First manual. Is the manual a source of law? Is it subject to judicial review? It would be very helpful to learn about that. Thank you.",
        "19": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the parties. It's quite long, but there's no need to worry about scribbling down the terms of the question, as a written copy will be given to them at the beginning of the pause. My question is as follows. What would be the scope of the judicial scrutiny carried out by the domestic courts in applications for judicial review of a negative decision by the Secretary of State in relation to release of a whole life prisoner under Section 30, paragraph 1 of the Crime Sentences Act 1997? In particular, would the scrutiny be as narrow as that suggested by the applicant? Paragraphs 42 to 43 of his observations. And then the second particularity, and I would say this is not part of the written text that you'll get. Here I'm thinking of the local authority housing cases, where people are rejected from their housing to failure to comply with the legal conditions, and where the nature of the judicial scrutiny of such administrative decisions under Article 8 of the Convention has been explained by the courts. And the question here is, would the domestic court have to verify that the Secretary of State had actually exercised his statutory power of release under Section 30, paragraph 1, compatibly with the whole life prisoner's rights under Article 3 of the Convention in the particular circumstances of the case? And would the domestic court order the Secretary of State to release the whole life prisoner if the latter could establish that on the facts and circumstances of his case, his continued imprisonment, despite his whole life sentence, is no longer justified on legitimate penological grounds? And the third and last indent is, would the domestic court examine such matters as the question, what would amount to a legitimate penological ground in this context, as the government suggests at paragraph 27 of their obligations? Thank you.",
        "20": "Thank you. We have heard that none of the prisoners was released, but what I would be interested to hear is whether any of the prisoners since winter has applied, regardless whether he was denied or was not denied. So whether he applied and how then, what was the procedure then, and how that was done, and whether any procedural safeguards in connection with that, whether any procedural safeguards are provided once the person, the prisoner, is applying for the review. Then you have told us then that the prisoner may come whenever. And as soon as the Article 3 standard for continuum detention has dropped away. So you have told us and you emphasized several times that a person can apply, but when actually there is obligation really to get a review, not just to apply, but to get a review in terms that you are saying as soon as the Article 3 standard for continuous detention has dropped away. So to what extent is that determinative to get a review? And then the question, third question, when the person is entering the prison, is the person getting any information on early release? In general, I'm asking. In general, not only for the whole life prisoners. And has McLaughlin or Winter changed anything in this respect for life prisoners? So are they told? Because European prison rules are requiring that, and I'm not quite sure how the domestic system is regulating that. Thank you.",
        "21": "I would have a question concerning the Norwegian law. We are here, we have two laws. We have Article 10.2 of the Tax Assessment Act and we have Chapter 12 on tax fraud of the Penal Code. And in the case at hand, we have learned that the courts, when assessing the criminal punishment, they took into account the administrative tax surcharges. I wonder, and the government argued that this was, as it was said, a statutory law demand. I would like to understand was that discretionary or is there a duty in the law to take into account the administrative punishment that has been before? And if the procedure had been vice versa, so if there had been first criminal punishment and then the conclusion of the administrative procedure, I read that in the event that the conditions imposing a tax surcharge are fulfilled, the surcharge will normally be assessed at 30%. Would that mean that this normally that we would have an exception if there had been already a high criminal punishment to reduce the administrative sanction? That would be my question, thank you.",
        "22": "Thank you Mr. President. My question goes to the government, but of course the applicants may also take a position on this question. In fact, I have two questions to the government. I would like the government to elaborate on the consequences, the negative consequences for a Norwegian citizen who does not pay the tax surcharge. The government pleads that there are no penal means to impose the tax surcharge. No imprisonment, no criminal record, no publicity. Are there any negative consequences for someone who does not pay the surcharge in whatever form, as a fine or any other form of negative consequence that may arise from the fact of not having paid the tax surcharge? And my second point is related to the interaction between the administrative and the criminal procedures. In what measure is the tax surcharge applied in the administrative procedure taken into account in the conviction and sentencing in the criminal procedure? Are the facts established in the administrative procedure binding for the criminal procedure? Is the tax surcharge considered in order to diminish the criminal penalty? And these questions could be put as an alternative seen from the perspective of the criminal procedure seen from the other side of the coin. Are the facts established in the criminal procedure binding for the administrative procedure? Is the criminal penalty considered in order to lower the tax surcharge? So I would like the government to elaborate on this interaction, possible interaction between the effects of each of these procedures in one another. Thank you very much.",
        "23": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would ask both parties for very short comments about concerning the situation from 29 June of 2007 when Kishnev Court of Appeal quashed the decision from 26 June of 2007 about house arrest and reordered applicants detention in jail pending the trial for next 20 days. I would ask for very short comments in the context of both exhaustion of domestic remedies and effectiveness of domestic remedies. Thank you.",
        "24": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. The first question for both parties. I would like to have more detailed information about the regime of the house arrest in the Republic of Moldova. What are the exact obligations imposed on a person placed under house arrest? This is the first question. The second question is for the government. The government has emphasized that the residents did not provide any resources to contest the decision to assign residents. I would like to ask the residents to respond to this argument and perhaps also to explain that they were right not to provide resources to contest the decision to assign residents. Thank you.",
        "25": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to the government. So my first question is, I'd like to find out whether, from the point of view of the government, the preventive measures during the domestic criminal proceedings against the applicant represented a continuing situation. And the second question, in the paragraph 69 of the government memorial to the Grand Chamber, it stated that from the point of view of the government, the applicant requests and consent to be placed under the house arrest, I'm citing, can decrease the domestic court's duty for the justification of the arrest measure. In that respect, could you please give an example of legal provision, if any, from the Moldovan legislation and or from the domestic judicial practice and or from the case law of the European court in favor of this statement? And the last question, take into account your pleadings before today, I mean today, I'd like to find out where in the Moldovan legislation is stated that the house arrest represent, by itself, an alternative measure to the detention pending trial. Thank you.",
        "26": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two very short questions arising out of what was said by the two distinguished counsel for the applicant and the government. And this is irrespective of what we have in our dossier. It's simply to help me clarify my ideas, to make sure I understand everything. The first question is addressed to counsel for the applicant. You said, if I understood you correctly, that the domestic courts did not adequately consider alternative measures, by which I understand alternative measures apart from house arrest. What other alternative measures do you have in mind in this respect, presumably alternative measures which are available under domestic legislation? And the second question is for counsel for the government. And it, I suppose, reflects more or less another question which has already been put by one of my colleagues. Does the government consider, in effect, that there was a reasonable prospect of the applicant being released on bail after he had been placed on house arrest, that is, considering the previous insistence of the prosecution on the tension on the one hand and the court's repeated agreement with the prosecution's point of view on the other? Thank you.",
        "27": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to the applicant. The question is connected to the paragraph one of your memorial before the Grand Chamber. So in paragraph one of your memorial before the Grand Chamber, it's stated that the promotion by the applicant of the respective mobile application, I'm quoting, in itself was an expression of political opinion. So my question is, what are the reasons for such a statement? And in the same context, what do you mean by saying expression of political opinion? Thank you.",
        "28": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have one question, which is addressed to both parties. The Grand Chamber is called upon to assess two judgments from the Courier, one adopted on the 10th of October, the other one adopted on the 18th of October. In the first one, the Courier upheld a decision of the Election Commission, according to which the applicant was under an obligation to refrain from further unlawful conduct. In the second judgment, the Courier upheld a decision according to which a fine was imposed. When I'm reading the reasoning in both judgments, the Courier said that the applicant had infringed the principle of proper exercise of rights. However, in the second judgment of 18th of October, the Courier added one element. It said the actions of the applicant also amount to unlawful campaign activities during the period foreseen in section 139 of the Electoral Procedure Act, likely to influence voters' choice. And my question is, how am I to understand that this latter element added only in the second judgment of the Courier? Does it imply that they're under Hungarian law is a period during which campaign activities are in general prohibited? And if so, is it a general prohibition, or is it limited to the specific circumstances of this case? In other words, is it limited in time, the means, the geography, the place? So how am I to understand the element added by the Courier in his judgment of 18th of October, 2016? Thank you.",
        "29": "Thank you very much. I have questions to both parties relating to the, I would say, procedural constraints of our court when dealing with applications or defense arguments by the parties. They touch somewhat on the two questions that have already been raised. First question to the applicant, when in the written observation of the applicant describes why its freedom of expression has been interfered with, it mentions two elements. In the first place, the applicant says that it has provided to the voters a means of dissemination of their opinions, and that is what you argued orally today. The second element is, and that is what my colleague Gri\u0163co referred to, is that advancing this app was in itself the expression of a political opinion. The government has argued that this second aspect was not a matter that was being discussed before the domestic courts. My question therefore is, is this also your view? And if so, can this second aspect play a role in the proceedings before our court? The second question is for the government about the legitimate aim being invoked to justify the restriction that has been imposed on the applicant. The government is arguing that the prohibition of publishing photos of ballots, that such a practice can potentially have a huge impact on the integrity of the elections, that the secrecy and the fairness of elections are at stake. However, it has also been argued by the applicant that the Courier, the Supreme Court, in its judgment rejected a number of arguments relating to the secrecy and the fairness of the elections, at least in this case, and that the only justification retained by the Courier was that there was an infringement of the principle of the proper exercise of rights, namely a call to the voters to use the ballots, the ballot papers, for another purpose than for expressing the voters' opinion on the question in the referendum. My question is, I know that you developed this somewhat early, but I would like to ask you a very specific question. In light of the decision of the Courier to reject a number of justifications, can the government come back before our courts and, notwithstanding that decision of the Courier, still rely on a number of these justifications? Or what about the procedural difficulties raised here for us? Thank you.",
        "30": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to thank you for your very informative statements, pleadings. My question relates a little bit to the former question as regards the impact and concentrates on the proportionality test. The question is addressed to both parties. When balancing competing rights and making an assessment of the proportionality, one of the factors to be taken into account is the expected impact of that expressive medium. And my question to the government is what was, according to the authorities, the expected impact of the mobile phone application, taken into account that no connection could be made between the voter and the voter, and also the fact that the political party that made available the app is, as you said yourself, a very small one? And the same question, but then a bit differently formulated, I would like to pose to the party. What was, according to the party, the expected impact? And what did the party actually aim at reaching while making this application available?",
        "31": "Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is related to the applicants, and I'm referring to the first part of your oral submissions today, where you're referring to the possibility of individuals to upload photos in the social media platforms. Is it your case today that by uploading voting ballots in a mobile app enjoys the same level of protection under the convention? The second question, again, is directed to the applicants' representative, but the government can comment if they so wish. If I understand correctly, what I'm about to ask has not been raised at domestic level. However, I'm inclined, for the sake of the argument, to ask the following. What has happened with the disputed mobile app and the related photos after the referendum? Have they been destroyed? When? And is it reasonable to require safeguards on what could potentially happen with such data later? Thank you.",
        "32": "Thank you, Mr. President. I am mindful that the way in which the case is presented to the Grand Chamber is that we are first and foremost dealing with an Article 6 complaint and not Article 9 or Article 1 or Protocol 1 complaint. In that respect, I would like to ask the applicant mainly, but the government can respond as well, to clarify the essence of the right of access to court complaint. In paragraphs 11 and 12 of the applicant's observation, it is stated that the right to access to a court implies an effective access to a decision on the merits of the case without a predetermined and a biased decision of the domestic courts. It's then explained in paragraph 12 more deeply, where it's stated, instead of comparing the titles to property of the two parties, the courts dismissing the applicant's claim over their church reduced their role to a formal one, deciding that the will of the majority applies, therefore the church should not be returned. And here it's where I want to pose the question. Assuming that the court would accept the government's invitation to look at the access to court issue, not in the abstract, but looking at it, how it was applied in your case, the applicant's case. If I read paragraphs 32 and 34 of the Chamber Judgment, where the Court of Appeal judgment is described and then the judgment of the High Court of Cassation, it says in paragraph 2 of the Chamber Judgment that the Court of Appeal explicitly looked to the fact that the title that the Orthodox Church received, even though initially unlawful, had become valid when the transfer was made, and then it says, with the result that the action to recover possession was ill-founded. The High Court of Cassation also refers to the fact that for title to property to be assessed, there needs to be a possession under the ordinary rules. So could you please clarify, is it your contention that in your case, no examination of the title deeds took place? And as you described, therefore, the role of the courts were purely a formal one. And if that is the case, could you please explain how the Grand Chamber should read the Court of Appeals judgments and the High Court of Cassation judgment on that particular issue? And the government, as I said, could clarify its position as well. Thank you.",
        "33": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma premi\u00e8re question concerne pour les deux parties, je dirais. Est-ce que ces deux principes qui figurent en fait dans la l\u00e9gislation, \u00e7a veut dire l'application du droit commun et les crit\u00e8res de la volont\u00e9 de la majorit\u00e9 sont conciliables? Je vous demande justement de faire une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question tout en prenant compte la d\u00e9cision de la Cour constitutionnelle de 2012 qui conforme sa d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure. Deuxi\u00e8mement, ma question concerne surtout le gouvernement, mais bien s\u00fbr aussi le r\u00e9cr\u00e9ant, si vous pouvez r\u00e9pondre. J'aimerais savoir les exemples de restitution d'un lien de culte \u00e0 l'\u00c9glise gr\u00e9co-catholique, m\u00eame si la volont\u00e9 des croyants orthodoxes n'\u00e9tait pas dans ce sens. Donc, bien s\u00fbr, il faut mettre \u00e0 part la d\u00e9cision de la haute cour de 20 juin 2013 qui concerne un bien qui n'est pas utilis\u00e9 par les fid\u00e8les orthodoxes et qui ne fournit pas en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 un exemple de ce type. Donc, j'aimerais savoir les autres exemples de justice. Merci beaucoup.",
        "34": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions which are principally addressed to the respondent government, but the applicant is free to answer these questions also in their reply. First of all, Article 329 of the Code of Civil Procedure, now Article 514, provides for the possibility of introducing an appeal in the interests of the law before the High Court of Cassation and Justice, where the same questions of law have been decided differently by different courts. The purpose of this action is to ensure the uniform interpretation and application of the law. And I'd like the government to inform us why this mechanism was never deployed in response to the divergent case law, which the government itself has recognized existed, on the restitution of places of worship. My second question, which also refers to Romanian legislation, concerns Ordinance 94 of 2000, which provided that the legal status of buildings which serve as places of worship shall be established by a special law. From the information in the case file before us, it appears that no such law was ever adopted. So it would be useful if the government could outline what that special law was intended to provide, and more importantly, why it was never adopted. The question which is addressed principally to the applicants, but again, the government is invited or welcome to respond to it in their reply, relates to Article 4 of Legislative Degree 126-1990, which provides that the state may provide for support for the construction of new churches and may make available appropriate land and funds for that purpose. Again, according to the information in the case file, many other Greek Catholic parishes have sought to avail of Article 4. My question is therefore, has the applicant parish done so? And if not, why not?",
        "35": "Thank you, Mr. President. May I take up on the last question of my learned colleague? Is there a law in place that would, in fact, provide details in regard to the legislative decree of 1990, in particular regarding Article 4? So is there a law implementing it? Now, I'm sorry, but I really have to ask very elementary questions for those who know Romanian law. I'm not privileged in that regard. So could the government, but of course the applicant's lawyer is free to comment, could the government explain to me what would be an ordinary vindicatio rei procedure or proceedings in a case that is not related to this specific situation? And you emphasize that it is about a specific situation. I will come back to that. I ask this, and I would like clarification, because of the following reason. I've seen a number of judgments where, and it's also in the judgment of the chamber, that the procedure is generally, as in most countries, a comparison of titles. Now in the countries I'm familiar with, the more recent title shall prevail. And the more recent title in those countries I know would be the claim of the Orthodox, because in this case, in 1967, in other cases anyway after 1948, it was transferred to the Orthodox. It seems to be that this is not the case in Romania, because if this were the case, there is no reason for the special law. So I wonder what is really the situation in this type of return of property cases. Without the interpretation given by the Constitutional Court, I understand that your position is that this is a specific issue because it is related to the exercise of freedom of religion. And I understand that there can be arguments made that a special law applies. But what if there is no special law? Is it the case that the 1990 decree, legislative decree, in principle, annulled the titles, created a situation where possession matters, but title is not anymore in place, the 1948 title? I just don't understand the situation. Now may I ask again the government to explain the relevance of census. Was the census taken with a specific provision indicating that those who declared to pertain to one or another religion express their wish to maintain property? Was this purely statistical or was it an expression of will? The people who were subjected to the census aware of possible implications of their choice. Secondly, is the declaration in the census an indicator of the actual religious practice? Do you have data on actual religious practice compared to the census data? May I ask a hypothetical? Imagine that there is a diocese where there were 100 Greek Catholic churches before 1948. And the Greek Catholics were also in the diocese in an absolute majority or relative majority. Let's imagine, and this is my hypothetical question, that today, according to the statistical average, they are below 1%, but we have cases where there were 30%. So imagine, let's take that scenario. Let's assume that there are 30% believers of the Greek Catholic faith. Is it the case that although there are 30% believers following the principle of the wish or will of the majority as expressed in the census, all 100 shall be returned, all 100 former Catholic churches shall be kept by the orthodox majority? Is that result foreseeable in case the bill of the majority is followed as indicated by the or understood by the constitutional court? I think that's one more question to the government. Do I understand you correctly that this being a special law, the decisive consideration is the will of the majority? So in other words, if under the Vindicatio Rei title, it would be Greek Catholic to have the title, this is a precondition for a consideration by the court. And then the considerations of the religious majority shall prevail. And if so, is this something that falls under the exceptions of Golder? Because it is not an absolute right to have access to the court. So the question is whether this is one of the exceptions recognized by Golder. Thank you very much.",
        "36": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is addressed to the applicant, but of course the government can also take a position on this. The applicant's position is that, and the core of the applicant's argumentation is that the rights of a minority are illusory if they are in the hands of the majority. Now, in order to check if Romanian law, the 1990 law, effectively protects in practical terms the property rights of the Greek Catholics, could you please provide the court with the overall market value for property returned until today to Greek Catholics in terms of buildings and building area? And could you compare this market value with the market value for the property not returned? You need not, of course, to be precise. An overall idea would suffice. Thank you very much.",
        "37": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une toute petite question qui est pos\u00e9e conjointement aux 2 partis. J'\u00e9tais \u00e9tonn\u00e9 d'entendre pendant les plaidoiries que les 2 partis ne sont pas d'accord sur les travaux parlementaires qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de la notion de droit commun, qui me para\u00eet essentielle dans cette affaire. Il est tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9tonnant qu'on ne puisse pas se mettre d'accord sur ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement dit au Parlement. Et il serait utile que les 2 partis puissent donner une r\u00e9ponse univoque sur ce que veut signifier droit commun. Est-ce vraiment le droit traditionnel de la comparaison des titres, comme le pr\u00e9tend l'avocate de la partie r\u00e9currente, ou est-ce que c'est la r\u00e8gle de la volont\u00e9 de la majorit\u00e9? On peut interpr\u00e9ter une loi, \u00e7a c'est tout \u00e0 fait normal, mais on pourrait quand m\u00eame pouvoir se mettre d'accord sur ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit au Parlement. Il m'int\u00e9resserait que les 2 partis puissent donner une r\u00e9ponse plus univoque et pas totalement contradictoire quant \u00e0 cet effet objectif. Je vous remercie.",
        "38": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I also thank the parties for their interventions. I have a question to the government. You have stated here that you have laws in Sweden that protect the migrants. You have quoted here the Swedish law on migration, the Swedish law for aliens, the preparatory work for aliens. But you didn't mention here if you have relevant national or policy guidelines that indicate general practice regarding the burden of proof of asylum seeker, namely more concrete, if you have certain indication to give in advance to asylum seeker, how they have to formulate the police advice for their own countries, namely for Iraq, because your migration board find that this is not satisfactory for Sweden. Do you know exactly how this have to be given, how many witnesses have to be there, how much, how many indication the police had to give in the concrete case for each country, or this depends for case to case? Thank you very much, Mr. President.",
        "39": "Thank you, Mr. President. My first questions go to the representatives of the applicants. Mr. Gericke, you read out a statement of the first applicant, Mr. Nd, and my question is are you still in contact with both applicants, and do both of them tell you that they want to pursue their applications? The second question concerns the events of 13 August 2014. You say that the applicants were not given the slightest possibility to raise any arguments against their expulsion, but you also say that the legal issue of this case is not asylum. What would have been the applicants' arguments against their removal? Now my next questions go to the government, and the first question concerns Article 38 of the Asylum Law of 2009. It was mentioned today. It grants the ambassador of Spain the competence to allow people who are in need of international protection their transfer to Spain. Now AIDA, the Asylum Information Database, writes that this provision lacked implementation, and this was repeated by the representative of the UNHCR. But did I understand you correctly today when you mentioned the Royal Decree of 1995, that this decree was still in force and is still in force even after the adoption of this law? I would be interested in an answer to this. And finally, as to the Benin-Ansar border post, it has been said several times even today that there were difficulties for sub-Saharan asylum seekers, sub-Saharan people, to reach this post, not only before 1 September 2014, but even afterwards. Do you have an explanation for this, and do you have any evidence for these alleged facts? And finally, may I add also a question to the representative of the UNHCR, Mrs. O\u2019hara. You mentioned today and also in your written statement that until November 2014 there was, I quote, no mechanism in place for persons seeking international protection at the Benin-Ansar border post or anywhere else at the Spanish border. But the Spanish government states and has submitted to us evidence that the building of the Special International Protection Unit at this border crossing only facilitated the lodging of asylum claims. And they have submitted concrete figures which shows that there have been asylum claims even before 1 September 2014. Now how do you comment on these concrete figures? Thank you very much.",
        "40": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would have two questions, both addressed to the representatives of the applicants, but of course the other participants are invited to comment if they so wish. My first question is very similar to the second question that was addressed by my colleague Judge Kucsko-Stadlmayer. Namely, I heard one of the representatives of the applicants saying that, I quote, this case is about the right to raise arguments before expulsion or against expulsion. And it was underlined that this would be any legal argument, not only an asylum claim. Now I wonder what would, what were actually the intentions of the applicants, what would be the arguments that they wanted to raise in the particular situation, but they were prevented to do so because they were removed from the territory of Spain at this particular occasion. My second question refers to the arguments that were raised actually by the Spanish government. The Spanish government, they say that the applicants lack victim status because they haven't proved that they actually participated in the events of the 13th of August, 2014. The government say that no photographs were submitted by the applicants in the present situation, that no alternative expert report was submitted by the applicants or their representatives, and that the account of events as submitted by the applicants is not credible. They refer to the injuries, broken leg of ND, and also injuries that supposedly the second applicant has suffered during the events in question. Now I wonder what is your reply, I turn here to the applicants, what is your exactly reply to those assertions by the government? Thank you very much.",
        "41": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have the same question for both parties, for government and representative of applicants. Can you establish where both applicants, and D and T are now, and how long time? And if you can, can you offer us some relevant, serious proof, evidence about it? Thank you.",
        "42": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have some questions related to facts for both parties. First, for the representative of the applicants, concerning Indy, what is the exact year when he left Mali, going to Mauritania, 2011 or 2012? And also, why did he never try to ask asylum in any of the consulates or embassies between 2011 and 2014 before his first jumping into the fence? And also, I'm interested in which was the reasons later on when he was already in Spain in a second jump that he asked asylum, and he was denied twice for the Office of the United Nations for High Commission for Refugees, which one were the reasons, legal reasons? And in relation with Indy, in the facts, the applicant said that he escaped from Ivory Coast in 2012 because he was at risk. Was there a conflict? Then later on, when he has arrived to Melilla in the second jump and to Spain in the mainland in October 2014, why has he never asked asylum in Spain? Well, and in both cases, why did he never try to enter Spain for the official entrances or without visa of work? Well, my last question for the representative of the applicants, did they present in some moment in all this process, in the administrative process in Spain, some official documents of identity, like passport, identity cards, records of births, or anything to demonstrate who they were or their country of origin? And now my questions for the government. According to the government, the identification of the persons asking asylum must be conducted at the official border crossing or in the Spanish embassies and consulates, we have heard, and it is in the report. Then could you explain, given the facts of the real possibilities for a real refugee to access to these means? And very concrete, in the exposition, you have said that after, in September 2014, was created the Bureau of Venezuela and Saar, but before it was also possible to ask for asylum. Could you give us some data, these persons' numbers, that they were brought when they jumped and they are the success? They are brought to the police station, because I suppose that there are also numbers. And also, I will thank some data about the numbers of persons who tried to jump the Melilla fence. And especially, it's interesting, if they have some features in common. I want to say, are they from the same country? They are a collective, or they are some characteristic, like they have the same race or ethnicity, or they come from the same countries in war? What is your data? And well, thank you very much.",
        "43": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma premi\u00e8re question, c'est pour le gouvernement, plut\u00f4t. Je me demande si la 10e disposition additionnelle ins\u00e9r\u00e9e par la loi organique du 4 mars 2015, qui instaure un r\u00e9gime sp\u00e9cial pour Ceuta et M\u00e9rida, et qui pr\u00e9voit aussi la possibilit\u00e9 de refoulement, je dirais que, est-ce que cette disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux droits internationaux et aussi \u00e0 la jurisprudence de Strasbourg? Et ma deuxi\u00e8me question concerne plut\u00f4t les deux parties, aussi les tiers intervenants, s'ils le veulent, bien s\u00fbr. Donc, c'est int\u00e9ressant dans le dossier que d'apr\u00e8s les ONG et les tiers intervenants, le poste fronti\u00e8re de B\u00e9n\u00e9 Enzar n'est pas accessible aux migrants sapsa\u00e9riens se trouvant aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s marocains. Donc, est-ce que vous connaissez les raisons de cette affirmation ou de cette pratique, je dirais? Et quelle est la situation aujourd'hui au poste B\u00e9n\u00e9 Enzar? Merci beaucoup.",
        "44": "Thank you very much. I would just have one question to the applicants. I understand that you do not claim that Spain did not have a right to build a fence at the border. The fence that was built was, as I understand, meant to be unsurmountable. Obviously, it was unsurmountable for women, for children, for old people. There were only young men able to climb over the fence, and that's the starting point of your complaint. So my question is, in your view, under international law, would it be possible or allowed for Spain to build now a really unsurmountable fence, even not surmountable by young men? Thank you.",
        "45": "Thank you very much. First, my question is for representative of UNHCR. So you have many representatives and offices in Africa. Have you ever came across information or fact that there are really organized groups which are taking money and directing people to cross the border of European or given country? This is a first question. And the second question for representatives of government, but of course, applicants are representatives if they would like, if they wish, they can comment that as well. Do you, whether there was a violation during the crossing the border? And if yes, do you have any data or number of guardians civil who suffered for that?",
        "46": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais, moi aussi, poser une question principalement \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentante du DHR. Mais bien s\u00fbr, si les partis voudraient commenter, ce serait bien. Vous \u00eates au courant, madame, que dans l'affaire Claifia contre l'Italie, la Grande chambre s'est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e au projet d'article de la Commission du droit international des Nations unies sur l'expulsion des \u00e9trangers. Et que dans l'article 2 de ce projet, il y a une d\u00e9finition de la notion d'expulsion. Et dans cette d\u00e9finition, la Commission du droit international exclut l'extradition, \u00e7a, c'est clair, mais elle exclut \u00e9galement la non-admission, terme qu'elle pr\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la notion de refoulement. Donc la non-admission est exclue du champ d'application des articles de la CDI sur l'expulsion des \u00e9trangers. Et puis apr\u00e8s, dans la disposition qui concerne l'expulsion collective, la Commission du droit international se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de la notion g\u00e9n\u00e9rique d'expulsion, ce qui signifie que, d'apr\u00e8s la lecture de ce projet, de la notion d'expulsion collective est exclue la non-admission d'\u00e9trangers. En m\u00eame temps, on voit que dans le commentaire de la d\u00e9finition, il est dit que cette port\u00e9e restrictive de la notion d'expulsion est sans pr\u00e9judice, je cite, des r\u00e8gles du droit international relatives aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s. Et ma question est la suivante. Comment est-ce que vous voyez l'articulation entre la d\u00e9finition restrictive de la notion d'expulsion qui exclut la non-admission d'une part et le droit des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, notamment le principe de non-r\u00e9foulement d'autre part? Articulation entre les deux. Merci beaucoup.",
        "47": "Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Manifestement, au c\u0153ur de nos d\u00e9bats se trouve la relation entre le droit \u00e0 demander l'asile et l'interdiction pos\u00e9e par l'article 4 du protocole 4 des expulsions collectives. Mais cette discussion de principe est parfois un peu obscurcie par des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l'affaire et notamment les discussions sur le point de savoir s'il existait ou non des possibilit\u00e9s effectives de demander l'asile dans ces enclaves. Donc permettez-moi de formuler cette fois-ci la question de fa\u00e7on assez abstraite pour que les positions soient bien claires aux yeux de la Cour. Est-ce que les parties et les parties intervenantes consid\u00e8rent que dans des conditions o\u00f9 il serait \u00e9tabli que toute personne consid\u00e9rant qu'elle est menac\u00e9e de traitement contraire \u00e0 la Convention peut demander l'asile, des personnes qui n'auraient pas eu recours \u00e0 cette possibilit\u00e9 effective pourraient n\u00e9anmoins invoquer l'article 4 du protocole 4? C'est donc la question de principe et non pas les modalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cises dans cette affaire sur laquelle je voudrais avoir votre position. Merci beaucoup.",
        "48": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'aurai 2 questions. Ces 2 questions s'adressent principalement au gouvernement, mais elles sont \u00e9videmment ouvertes aux commentaires \u00e9ventuels des r\u00e9cr\u00e9ants. La 1re question concerne la d\u00e9cision du tribunal de Campobas, le tribunal pour mineurs de Campobas de 2006, concernant l'agr\u00e9ment accord\u00e9 aux r\u00e9cr\u00e9ants pour l'adoption internationale. C'est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui est dans le dossier et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9 aussi ce matin dans la pl\u00e9duerie des parties r\u00e9cr\u00e9antes. Alors, dans cette d\u00e9cision, je traduis de l'italien, les r\u00e9cr\u00e9ants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 adopter donc 1 ou 2 mineurs, 6 fr\u00e8res, de nationalit\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8re, dont l'\u00e2ge implique, par r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge des \u00e9poux r\u00e9cr\u00e9ants, une diff\u00e9rence pas sup\u00e9rieure aux 45 ans, sauf les d\u00e9rogations pr\u00e9vues par l'article 6, alin\u00e9a 6, de la loi 149 de 2001. Alors, ma question est la suivante. Compte tenu des d\u00e9rogations pr\u00e9vues par cette loi de 2001 et compte tenu de l'\u00e2ge, notamment de M. Campanelli, nous savons qu'entre M. Campanelli et Mme Paradiso, il y a une diff\u00e9rence d'\u00e2ge de 12 ans, de l'\u00e2ge de M. Campanelli au moment de la naissance de l'enfant, l'enfant est n\u00e9 le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2011. Donc, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, M. Campanelli avait 5 ans, 5 ans et 3 mois. Alors, ma question est, est-ce qu'avec cet \u00e2ge, et donc la diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 d'\u00e2ge entre M. Campanelli et l'enfant, est-ce que l'agr\u00e9ment de 2006 \u00e9tait une base suffisante pour l'adoption? Premi\u00e8re question. Deuxi\u00e8me question. L\u00e0, le tribunal pour mineurs en Italie, on l'a vu dans le dossier, est compos\u00e9 de 4 juges. Deux sont des magistrats professionnels, deux sont des experts. Ma question est la suivante. Est-ce qu'on peut expliquer quel est le r\u00f4le des experts dans la d\u00e9cision? A quel titre, comment ils interviennent dans la d\u00e9cision? Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "49": "...gouvernement italien, m'aide \u00e0 bien comprendre un passage de la d\u00e9cision du tribunal pour mineurs de Campo Basso. Je voudrais \u00e9viter une erreur dans cette lecture. Je lis dans cette d\u00e9cision et je cite \u00ab Il faut donc avant tout mettre un terme \u00e0 cette situation ill\u00e9gale dont le maintien aurait valeur de ratification d'une conduite ill\u00e9gale mise en \u0153uvre par violation ouverte des dispositions de notre ordre juridique. En cons\u00e9quence, il est n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9loigner le mineur des \u00e9poux Campanelli et de le placer dans une structure appropri\u00e9e. \u00bb Ma question est donc la suivante. \u00c0 la lecture de ce passage, on a le sentiment que le tribunal d\u00e9duit de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9cessaire et in\u00e9luctable la s\u00e9paration de l'enfant des \u00e9poux Campanelli de l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la situation. Est-ce que cette suffisance qui semble d\u00e9couler de ce raisonnement, de cette affirmation, est-ce que le caract\u00e8re suffisant, in\u00e9luctable de la d\u00e9cision est bien contenu dans ce passage ou est-ce que j'en fais une lecture erron\u00e9e?",
        "50": "Thank you, President. I would have a question to the applicant. I would like to understand the expectations ex ante of the parents. I understand when the mother went to Russia, she had the expectation ex ante that she could start a family life with a child born there under the Russian legislation for two months. And her expectation ex ante was also that the seminal fluid of her husband was used. But my question is, what was the expectation concerning the transfer of the family life started in Russia to Italy? What was her expectation, and then later on, the expectation of her husband concerning the continuation of family life in Italy? On what basis did they expect that they could continue family life in Italy? What was the basis for this expectation? What were the expectations, and on what basis? Thank you.",
        "51": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser une question au gouvernement, mais aussi les r\u00e9cr\u00e9ants peuvent r\u00e9pondre sur ce point. Je voudrais adresser la question du point de vue du droit international priv\u00e9 moderne. Est-ce qu'on ne peut pas d\u00e9duire du droit international priv\u00e9 moderne, par exemple, de l'article 23 du r\u00e8glement Bruxelles 2-10, une clause d'ordre public international qui, \u00e9ventuellement, prohibe le tourisme procr\u00e9atif, c'est-\u00e0-dire une GPA strictement commerciale? Est-ce que le droit international priv\u00e9 ne nous donne pas une piste r\u00e9levante pour r\u00e9soudre notre affaire? Merci.",

        "53": "Thank you, Mr. President. This case, at least tangentially, reminds me of three other cases that might be, I would be grateful for a discussion of that on the part of the government and on the part of the applicants. Two, one of these cases is against Italy, one of the leading cases in the beginning of the new court, Scodri and Giunta versus Italy, where also the child had been snatched away, that's the technical term, from the parents and put into a foyer, a fortetto near Florence. The second issue for me is Mamoso and Washington versus France, where the child, again, was taken away from the mother, regardless of the best interest of the child, and taken to her father, Washington, in the United States. And the follow-up, and partly reversing that trend in Mamoso and Washington, was Schurrug and Neulinger versus Switzerland. In all of these three cases, I see one axis around which the whole story turns, and that axis is obviously the best interest of the child. And as a follow-up to the excellent question by Judge Putovsky, I would like to know whether the Italian authorities were guided by the best interest of the child, at the time, of course, or whether they were guided by the fear not to ratify the formalistically assessed illegality of the process. Thank you very much.",
        "54": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser une petite question, peut-\u00eatre aux 2 parties, mais surtout au gouvernement. Il s'agit de la proc\u00e9dure telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e devant le tribunal pour mineurs de Campo Basso. On sait du dossier qu'\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, au mois de mai, \u00e0 la demande du parquet, il y a eu une ouverture d'une proc\u00e9dure d'adoptabilit\u00e9 de l'enfant qui \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tat d'abandon. Si j'ai bien compris, cette proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait encore pendante au moment o\u00f9 le tribunal pour mineurs a pris sa d\u00e9cision en octobre d'\u00e9loigner l'enfant et de le confier aux services sociaux. Ma question est maintenant, quelle est la relation entre ces 2 proc\u00e9dures? Est-ce que l'ordonnance rendue en octobre est un incident dans la proc\u00e9dure d'adoptabilit\u00e9? Est-ce que c'est quelque chose de tout \u00e0 fait s\u00e9par\u00e9? Comment et par qui a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi le tribunal en ce qui concerne cette d\u00e9cision d'\u00e9loignement? Merci.",
        "55": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. The first one to the applicant. The applicant states in his observations at paragraph 118 that there is no guarantee that Mr. Papashvili would have access to the necessary treatment. And then it states at the end of that paragraph, the Belgian government have not demonstrated that the applicant would have real and effective access to the treatment his medical condition requires. May I ask counsel for the applicants to explain what it is you consider to be the nature of the Article 3 violation in this case? Do I understand the applicant to suggest that if the applicant is expelled to Georgia and he would not receive the same treatment as he is now receiving under Dr. de Waal, the drug that he is receiving and the possibility of a stem cell transplant, that that would involve a violation of Article 3? If not, could you please explain what you consider to be real and effective access in those terms? Turning to my next question, which goes to both parties and primarily to the government. The government in its observations of 24 June last, which have now been elaborated during the hearing, states, and this is page 22 of the original in French, it's the fourth paragraph. And it is so in the English translation. The applicant is currently under the care of Dr. de Waal, a hematologist, and is being treated apparently experimentally. And the agent for the government used the words largely experimental here in her pleadings, with the drug Iprudinib not reimbursed under the Social Security scheme. I understand there has been a change now from 1st of August 2015. Without any further information, it is to be assumed that the care is being provided as part of a research protocol. And I think the counsel for the applicant is to be clear about what is the treatment that he's receiving, which is different or over and above what the general population would be receiving in Belgium. Thank you.",
        "56": "Oui, merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Afin d'essayer d'\u00e9clairer la Cour, je souhaiterais poser quatre questions pr\u00e9cises que j'adresse aux deux partis, et chacun pourra donner la r\u00e9ponse d'apr\u00e8s ces informations, ces convenances. La premi\u00e8re. Est-ce que vous savez pour quelle raison le tribunal de Cours n'a pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision d'office de la peine du requ\u00e9rant telle que pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 7, paragraphe 3 du nouveau code p\u00e9nal? La deuxi\u00e8me. Est-ce qu'on peut consid\u00e9rer que l'article 7 du nouveau code p\u00e9nal introduit un nouveau motif de r\u00e9vision additionnel \u00e0 ceux qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 253 du code de proc\u00e9dure? Troisi\u00e8me. Est-ce que l'ordre juridique andorran pr\u00e9voit un recours pour r\u00e9parer le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant la non-application de l'article 7 du nouveau code p\u00e9nal? Et enfin, quatri\u00e8me. Serait-il envisageable aujourd'hui, conform\u00e9ment au nouveau code p\u00e9nal de 2005, qu'un individu se voit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une peine de prison d'une dur\u00e9e limit\u00e9e et en m\u00eame temps \u00e0 une peine accessoire d'interdiction d'exercer sa profession \u00e0 vie? Je vous remercie.",
        "57": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have three questions. The first one is addressed to the representative of the applicant, and the other two questions are addressed to the government. The first question addressed to the representative of the applicants is, in fact, the repetition of a question already raised by the court in writing, but in my view, not sufficiently answered. Why did the applicants never lodge a request for family reunification after the final administrative decision in 2004, as they were entitled to, according to domestic legislation, either invoking the Aliens Act or the relevant applicable EU legislation? Is the explanation that in the assessment of the applicants, it was in any event bound to fail? Or in the alternative, is the explanation that for personal reasons, the applicants no longer were interested in family reunification in Denmark? My second question is addressed to the government. It concerns access to relevant information about administrative practice. The government relies on administrative practice as it is described in the memorandum of 1 December 2005, replacing an earlier memorandum of 29 September 2003. The applicants, however, argue that information on the application of the attachment requirement were not at all accessible. And they are invoking that they did not have access to information about this 12-year practice. And they also refer to criticism voiced by the parliamentary ombudsman, albeit it concerns other provisions. And therefore, my question is, how is information on administrative practice made public to persons affected by the legislation and to lawyers assisting such applicants? Have the two memorandums been published? Are they, for example, made available on the website of the relevant authority? My third question is somewhat hypothetical. And therefore, I do accept if it's not possible to answer the question. But nevertheless, I'll try. In case the court were to find that a 28-year rule, and thus the exception to the generally applicable attachment requirement, amounted to discrimination in violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 8, what would be the likely consequences of such a judgment? If I listened attentively, seemingly it has already been hinted, at least when the government agent said if it were to be repealed as a consequence of this case. But nevertheless, I would like to, if it is possible, to give at least some kind of assessment of what would be the likely consequence of a ruling against the government. Thank you.",
        "58": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question goes to the government. Of course, the applicant may also take the opportunity to express his views on this point. Now, the government has said repeatedly in various international fora that one of the purposes or one of the reasons why this legislation was enacted was the fact that, and I'm quoting from a reply that the government gave to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, but this quotation may be found in many other places, that among foreigners and Danish nationals of foreign extraction who live in Denmark, there is a widespread tendency to marry a person from one's own country of origin, among other reasons due to parental pressure, end of quote. My question is, is this still today the position of the Danish government that this is the reason why this measure was taken? And if not, why does the Danish government keep an annual statistical report concerning foreigners published by the Ministry of Refugee, Immigration, and Integration Affairs with the purpose of assessing the marriage patterns among immigrants and descendants from non-Western countries? Thank you very much.",
        "59": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma premi\u00e8re question concerne, s'adresse au gouvernement, et ma premi\u00e8re question concerne comment est-ce que le gouvernement danois r\u00e9agit par rapport aux critiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette loi par les instances du Conseil de l'Europe, \u00e7a veut dire le commissariat des droits de l'homme, aussi par le Haut commissariat pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et aussi par les organes des trait\u00e9s o\u00f9 on avait cit\u00e9 ici tout \u00e0 l'heure le comit\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9limination de toute forme de discrimination. On a aussi des autres comit\u00e9s des Nations unies, le comit\u00e9 pour l'\u00e9limination des droits de la femme. Et bon, \u00e7a veut dire que la plus grande totalit\u00e9 de ces comit\u00e9s qui ont d\u00fb analyser cette loi ont formul\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre des fortes critiques par rapport \u00e0 cette loi. Quelle \u00e9tait la r\u00e9action de votre gouvernement par rapport \u00e0 ces critiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es et comment est-ce que vous avez jug\u00e9 de les mettre en place? Ma deuxi\u00e8me question est d'une certaine mani\u00e8re li\u00e9e \u00e0 la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e par mon coll\u00e8gue tout \u00e0 l'heure.

Et le jugement aussi fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'avoir des mariages blancs pour justifier leur... leur effus d'accepter ce type de mariage.

        "60": "Just when you are responding to the question of Judge Kj\u00f8lbro, I would just like to clarify, if you could clarify two points. The applicant is living in Sweden, but he's working in Denmark. So for the purposes of the 12 years rule, whether he would be considered living in Sweden or in Denmark, and for the purposes of free movement, whether he would be considered free moving since he's still working in Denmark.

        "61": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Mes 2 questions s'adressent au gouvernement suisse. Ma 1re question tient \u00e0 l'article 261 bis de votre code p\u00e9nal qui donne une d\u00e9finition dans le titre, le nom de abstrait. Ca veut dire comment est-ce qu'on peut avoir dans le code p\u00e9nal une telle d\u00e9finition d'un tel article et o\u00f9 est-ce qu'on peut aller dans le limite de l'article 10 et dans les limitations de l'article 10 que vous exigez aujourd'hui dans la Cour en ayant un tel article dans votre code p\u00e9nal? O\u00f9 peut aller cet article en voyant, bon, l'opinion publique en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, au-del\u00e0 peut-\u00eatre de m\u00eame cas que nous, on prend aujourd'hui en consid\u00e9ration? Donc, \u00e7a vous enqu\u00eate o\u00f9 l'opinion publique aurait pu aller pour \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e dans l'article 261 bis ou non? Ma 2e question tient aussi au gouvernement suisse. Elle tient au fait de consid\u00e9ration des 2 tribunaux que vous d\u00e9fendez aujourd'hui. Et \u00e7a tient d'une question dont on a beaucoup parl\u00e9 ici, mais bon, notre Cour n'est pas cens\u00e9e de prendre en consid\u00e9ration l'histoire parce qu'on est quand m\u00eame en cours, mais quand m\u00eame, la notion de g\u00e9nocide vient et revient. Et voil\u00e0, si le tribunal de police avait tenu en consid\u00e9ration la notion de g\u00e9nocide comme d\u00e9finie par la Convention des Nations unies concernant le g\u00e9nocide, ce n'est pas le cas du tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Et je voulais vous demander o\u00f9 est-ce que vous \u00eates situ\u00e9s? Vous \u00eates situ\u00e9s dans une d\u00e9finition qui est donn\u00e9e par la Convention sur le g\u00e9nocide ou vous \u00eates situ\u00e9s sur une d\u00e9finition, si vous voulez, plus large de cette notion? Et ici, je fais appel, si vous vous rappelez, parce que je pense que tout le monde se rappelle, des commentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par Dame Rosalyn Higgins \u00e0 la fin de l'affaire de Bosnie contre la Serbie, quand elle disait, voil\u00e0, notre Cour, \u00e7a veut dire la Cour internationale de justice, se r\u00e9f\u00e8re seulement \u00e0 cette convention et \u00e0 une d\u00e9finition assez \u00e9troite du g\u00e9nocide telle qu'elle est donn\u00e9e dans cette convention. Je vous remercie beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "62": "Thank you, Mr. President, I have three questions, the first question goes to both parties, and the second and third question go only to the government, first question is the following. Article 5 of the 1956 law established a list of preventive measures, which enclude \"vivir honestamente\" live honestly. And to take well a prescription a key ravishing it's a tidy. All are orders that the judge may find necessary. What does this mean? What is the legal meaning of these two orders? For instance, does the violation of a civil or administrative law justify the application of preventive measures? Does the violation of a moral law justify the application of preventive measures? The reasons for my question are the following. The sentence of the tribunal the penalty the body is grounded in the fact that the applicants life was I'm quoting characteristic that the intensive frequent that's your name the limited is speak or they're not Malavita locale intense presence by preeminent elements of the local bed life Malavita locale. What is this? What is the Malavita locale? Second question between 2005 and 2013 the government provided elements statistical elements regarding the application of preventive measures. According to these elements from the government these measures were applied to over 30,000 persons. According to the Italian legal framework these measures may be applied to someone acquitted of a crime. After the acquittal. My question is how many of them of these 30,000 persons had been acquitted in criminal proceedings prior to the application of the preventive measure? Final question also regarding the statistics. In this same period of time 16,000 over 16,000 persons were convicted for violation of the preventive measures applied to them. My question is the following how many of them were sentenced to jail? I wonder if these elements statistical elements are not available to the government through the registro CIPI. Which was created it's a database which was created for the collection of information on all procedures regarding the personal and financial preventive measures. The elements that were provided by the government do not refer to the registro CIPI. My question is aren't the replies to these two questions that were already put to the government in the questions to this hearing aren't the replies to these questions available on the registro CIPI? Thank you very much.",
        "63": "Thank you, President. I have a question to the applicant's representative. It concerns the curfew which was imposed on the applicant. He had to stay in his home in Kazamasima from 10 p.m. at night until 7 a.m. in the morning. I would wish to be precise about the exception. The applicant could have applied for authorization to be absent from his home during this time. And my question to the applicant's representative is, did the applicant ask for an authorization to be absent from his home during the curfew? If so, what were the circumstances which he alleged in order to be absent? And was the request or were the requests granted? Thank you.",

        "65": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question, and eventually both parties can clarify. Looking at the regime, one of the main conditions imposed on the applicant is to start looking for work within a month. In the eventuality that the applicant finds a proper work, what is the impact of such a new situation over the other conditions imposed on the applicant, and especially to live in Casamassima and not to change his place of residence, to lead an honest and law-abiding life and not give cause for suspicion, not to return home later than 10 p.m. or to leave home before 7 a.m., not to go to bars, nightclubs, et cetera, and not to use mobile phones and radio communication devices. If the applicant finds a job, is there a possibility to revise the regime or at least certain conditions imposed on him, and how this revision procedure would work in practice? Thank you.",
        "66": "Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I would like to ask the government to specifically refer or answer an allegation made by the lawyer of applicant, namely that the 2010 Legge Delega was intended for other purposes mentioned by the lawyer of the applicant. In particular, it was recognized that there are no objective criteria and this legal void has to be undone. Secondly, based on the sentence of the Constitutional Court, it is a requirement that there ought to be external signs of the inclination to delinquency that are to be taken into consideration in the determination of these measures. Is there a clear jurisprudence that makes it foreseeable what are these external signs? And likewise, there is a requirement that there ought to be factual elements foreseen by the law in order to determine social danger. Again, what are those factual elements available in light of the Italian jurisprudence or if there is any other legal source applicable to the determination of the dangerousness? Finally, I have in front of me a sentenza of the Corte Constituzionale 135 of 2014. I understand that this is not about exactly the same problem because it is about misure di sicurezza. However, there is a certain overlap and in this sentenza, it's not clear to me what is the current position of the Italian Constitutional Court or other courts regarding the very nature of this procedure to be applied. In particular, I understand that the law has changed and we are dealing with the 1956 Act, but it's not clear to me what's the difference in that regard as to the procedure applicable. So was this person convicted in a process under the Code of \u2013 not convicted, sorry \u2013 was he put under measures of prevention under the Code of Criminal Procedure or what kind of procedure was applied in his case and what is the applicable procedural law in the case of similar measures today? And if, as it seems to be on the basis of this sentenza, it's the criminal procedure, then why is the government of the view that this is not a matter that falls under the criminal prong of Article 6 of the Convention? So what are the reasons in Italy for claiming that this is not a matter under Article 6 given that it is dealt, if I understand correctly, in a criminal procedure? Thank you very much.",

Malavita or whatever. I'm asking a very simple, but loaded question to both parties, namely, and I'm using the neutral term, has the defendant, the Tomaso, in this particular case, been sanctioned, not punished, I'm not saying punished, I'm saying sanctioned, because of who he was, because of what he was, because of what he was, on the one hand, or had he been sanctioned because of what he has done? To both parties. I think this is really, for me, this is the gist of the case. Then, the sub-question to that is, if he had been sanctioned, the Tomaso had been sanctioned, because of who he was, or what he was, why is that acceptable, or inacceptable in law, according to both parties?

There are decisions in the final judgments which are relevant, which concern also the civil claims of the applicants. And in one of them, there are also sums which are granted on a provisional basis, waiting for the final determination in a separate civil proceedings in favor of the applicants.

Does it consist of two distinct parts, a fine of 2,000 francs for the offense which we are discussing today and 2,000 francs for a previous offense? Or did the judge, in view of the two offenses, impose a combined lump sum? The second question goes to the applicant. In the case file, a question has been raised by the government as to who has paid the fine of 4,000 francs imposed on the applicant, in particular, whether it was not the newspaper which paid the fine. I would therefore wish to ask the applicant who paid the fine, you yourself or the newspaper for which you were working. Thank you.",
        "72": "Thank you. My question is addressed mainly to the government. The proceedings were secret according to the code of criminal procedure of the Canton of Vaud. Article 293 of the Swiss Penal Code establishes a general prohibition under penalty of fine to publish documents, deliberations, or investigations of any authority which are secret by law. In the literal words of the federal court on this case, the present case therefore concerns secrecy imposed by law rather by any official decision. This prohibition is, so to say, an across the board, a blanket prohibition without any reference to the presence of a public interest or to any legitimate reason to inform the public on the matters declared secret. The only exception of Article 293 refers to the secrets of minor importance. Now, my question is, in this case or in any other case which concerns specifically criminal judicial proceedings, differently from Stoll, in this case or in any other case concerning these proceedings, does this prohibition of Article 293 mean that in Swiss law any publication of a matter declared secret by law, in this case by the Code of Criminal Procedure of Canton of Vaud, any matter declared secret by law is automatically a punishable crime in the terms of Article 293 of the Penal Code? The government affirms that the penalty imposed was justified as protecting the presumption of innocence in the private life of the accused person. But my difficulty in the case is how the Swiss courts might have taken adequately account of the presence of a public interest on the information and of the consequences on the legitimate exercise of the freedom of expression when the law does not provide a toll for this aspect and imposes without exception a penalty on the publications of matter expressly defined as secret by law. My question is which are the practice, if any, of the Swiss courts on this matter, if there's any possibility to take into account this aspect. Thank you.",
        "73": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question aux 2 parties. Je souhaiterais savoir dans quelle mesure l'article publi\u00e9 dans l'illustr\u00e9 rend \u00e9tat de l'ensemble des informations obtenues par la r\u00e9daction. Y a-t-il eu d'autres pi\u00e8ces du dossier qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenues par la r\u00e9daction dont le contenu n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 dans l'article et dans ce cas, quel \u00e9tait l'arbitraire de s\u00e9lection si une telle situation de s\u00e9lection d'informations a eu lieu? Merci.",
        "74": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for both parties. Could the parties explain to me the difference between paragraph one and paragraph two of article 185A of the criminal procedure of the Canton of Vaud? And how, in particular, and if at all, whether sub-article two of article 185A impacts on article 293 of the criminal code, of the Swiss criminal code? My impression, that I stand to be corrected, is that this point was not argued, well, at least in the papers that we have in front of us, but for the sake of clarity, for the sake of completeness, at least from my own personal knowledge to understand exactly how these two provisions interact, if at all. I would like this clarification, if possible, from one of the parties or from both, if the parties cannot agree on a common ground. Thank you.",
        "75": "Thank you Mr. President. I would like to make some questions to all three parties because they referred to some information. It has been raised, the issue by the Moldovan government, by the applicant, of the unlawfulness of the so-called MRT court, derived mostly from two facts. First, that this court has not been created in accordance with Moldovan legislation. Secondly, because the whole general political system of public authorities, or the so-called MRT, is not recognized by the international community, by any country. So that is the reason for unlawfulness. I would like to ask if, independently from this lack of international recognition, whether the parties can somehow inform us whether the MRT courts, and particularly the Tiraspol People's Court, comply or do not comply with the requisites of any due process court. That is mostly the independence and impartiality. I mean, what is the information on the material conditions in this respect of this court. And the second question, which is more or less related, it has been raised, the issue of the irresponsibility of the Russian Federation, allegedly, as the territory of the MRT is under effective Russian control, in all aspects. So my question is, can we get some information whether the MRT judicial system follows or does not follow the general organizational lines of the Russian Federation judicial system, as could be deduced for the effective control of the Russian Federation. Thank you.",
        "76": "Thank you, President. A question to the parties which follows actually the question of Judge L\u00f3pez Guerra. It concerns the independence of the courts of the Moldovan Transnistrian Republic, the MRT. My question is, how is the independence of the courts in the MRT assured? Thank you.",
        "77": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for both parties, for the applicants and the government. And in the gender judgment, in paragraph 96, the court noted, thus a situation such as the one in the Czech Republic where medical professionals are not allowed to assist mothers who wish to give birth at home and where no specialized emergency aid is available may be said to increase rather than reduce the risk to life and health of the mother and newborn. And I would like the parties to comment on this, taking into account what we have heard, that the state has said that the standard and quality of healthcare is very important and the protection of life and health of mother and child as well. And on the other hand, that the applicants have in their observations and comments repeatedly questioned the absence of the regulatory impact assessment prior to the adoption of the relevant degrees in the Czech Republic. Maybe you could give us some more information about any statistics or research as to the cases of home birth without assistance or with unauthorized assistance in the Czech Republic and about the rate of complications that have occurred to have. It would be very fruitful for the answering of this question. Thank you very much. Thank you.",
        "78": "Thank you. I have first a question for the applicants. I would like to know that if there was an option to give birth in a home birth center, would this be an acceptable alternative for the applicant not to deliver at home? Or even if the home birth center exists in practice, will they choose in any way to give birth at home? And I have another question for both parties. If you can describe a little bit more in detail the administrative procedure for issuing a technical license to a midwife or midwives who will create a home birth center, which authorities are involved in the issuing of the technical license, which are the administrative procedures? Of course, the time to take in consideration is the respective time when the applicants gave birth. Thank you.",
        "79": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions to the government. And my first question is, what is the reason for not ordering the counsel to the applicant during the witness interrogation by the investigating judge? And the reason for my question is the national law, since according to the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 141, the Defense Counsel, in the circumstances of the case, in my understanding, was mandatory during the preliminary proceedings. And my second question, I understood from the government's submission today that the investigating judge had a good reason to exclude both the applicant and the counsel from the witness hearing, since they endangered the purpose of the hearing. However, we can read from the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 168C, that the prosecutor accused and the defense counsel shall be permitted to be present during the judicial examination of a witness by the investigating judge. However, the judge may exclude the accused from being present at the hearing if his presence would endanger the purpose of the investigation. But the law does not speak of the counsel at all in this respect. And my question is, if the counsel were ordered at that stage, what would have been the legal basis to exclude the counsel from the witness hearing? And my aim with this both question is to clarify the legal basis for the interrogation and whether it was carried according to the national law. Thank you.",
        "80": "Thank you. My question is put to both parties, the applicant and the government. It results from the dossier that during the time of the facts, object of the judgment of the G\u00f6ttingen court, that is during the 3rd of February, and also when the witnesses O and P gave a declaration to the investigating judge, that is the 19th of February, both witnesses O and P were illegally in Germany. And they left Germany very shortly after the declaration to the investigating judge. In the written observations of the applicant before this Grand Chamber, it is maintained that the witnesses O and P may have failed to attend the trial because they could have rendered themselves liable to prosecution in Germany for unauthorized entry and residence, and therefore they feared arrest. My question is, when the witnesses O and P made the declaration before the investigating judge, that is around the 19th of February, could they also, or reasonably, have feared or have suspected that they were liable to arrest or any other form of restrictive or punitive measure if they remained in Germany? I say that because also the regional judge, according to the paragraph 25 of the Chamber of Judgment, the regional court in G\u00f6ttingen explained that minor contradiction in the statement of the witnesses could be explained by their concern not to disclose their illegal residence status and activities to authorities. And also it seems the court considered that the witnesses maybe had failed problems with the police because of the situation of illegal residence. So in sum, the question would be, it would have been reasonable to presume or to suspect that the witnesses would leave Germany shortly after the declaration by fear of any police or judicial measure against them.",
        "81": "Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to the government. In paragraph 33 of written submissions dated 29 September 2014, the government states that it cannot submit to the court the list of lawyers that was made available to the applicant on 14 March 2007. Instead, the court was provided with another list of lawyers which, as is mentioned in the government submissions, I quote, contains the same data and information that was on the list which was given to the applicant on 14 March 2007. However, in this list, next to the name of the lawyer M.R., there is a note indicating that he is no longer active. Please explain this misstatement. Thank you.",
        "82": "Thank you. It's only a question to both parties, but mostly to the applicant. We know that the 14th of March of 2007, the applicant made a statement before the police at the police station, making a confession of the facts for what he was later sentenced. Then, at this time, the 14th of March, he was with assistance of the lawyer, M.R. Now, the following day, the 15th of March, he was brought before the investigating judge. It is not clear whether or not he had the assistance of any lawyer, and he made some declarations, complaining that he had never hired the lawyer, M.R., but that's more or less we know. Then, the following day, the 16th of March, he was brought again before the investigating judge. In this case, he was assisted by the lawyer, G.M., and we know that in this case, he remained silent, and he didn't refuse to answer any questions put to him by the investigating judge or the prosecution. Now, my question is, how did the applicant make the confession? Now, my question is that we know that he made a confession before the police at the police station, but then, did he repeat it, or did he confirm the context of this confession at any time before any judicial authority, either the investigating judge or the trial court, because we know they had the confession before the police. There was any confirmation of this confession? Thank you.",
        "83": "Thank you, President. I have one question for the applicant's representative. We heard from the government that no proceeding was ever initiated against the lawyer M.R. My question is, have you ever initiated any kind of proceeding against M.R. or any steps you took against lawyer M.R. for his behavior in representation of the applicant, including disciplinary proceeding before the Croatian Bar Association or any kind of proceeding? Thank you.",
        "84": "Thank you, Mr. President. It appeared in the submissions today that the applicant was not for the first time in the police station, at that police station. Have the parties any information whether the applicant knew during the interrogation that the lawyer was the former chief of the police?",
        "85": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question goes to both parties. According to Article 32, paragraph 4 of the Police Act, a person shall not be brought in the period from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. to a police station. Now we heard today that there is a difference of interpretation between the parties on this provision. According to the applicant, from this provision it can be drawn that a person should not have been questioned after 10 p.m. According to the government, there is no limit. There is no limit even for the duration of the interrogation. It can go on and on. It can last five, three, six, seven hours during the whole night. If I understood correctly, the position of the government. Now I would like to know what is the practice, what is the case law of Croatia on this particular point? Because we have heard the position of the parties, but we have not heard about the case law of the Croatian courts on this particular topic, which is an interesting feature of this case. Thank you.",
        "86": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions to both parties, I guess. My first question is, this is a typical case for the constitutional court. Because in terms of the rights of the defendant in criminal procedure, in terms of establishing the precedence in this area, in terms of resolving the problems such as we are now faced with, this would be the competence of the constitutional court par excellence. I did not find in the file, correct me if I'm wrong, any reference to the position of the constitutional court, one. And two, I would like to know whether that decision, if there was a substantive decision on the part of constitutional court, was a unanimous one or not. My second question goes beyond the case the way it's now discussed. And I don't want to prejudge it, obviously. But the real question, if we were, I emphasize the hypothetical aspect of this question, if we were to find a violation, what would be the legal consequences in Croatia? This goes primarily to the defense, I guess. Because the mere finding of the violation or the monetary reward in case we were to find a violation is not the obvious remedy. The obvious remedy, and I assume it is described in the Code of Criminal Procedure of Croatia, would be a retrial. And I trust this is in the Code of Criminal Procedure. One. Two, the next question, of course, is if there were to be a retrial, the evidence, the contaminated evidence obtained via the questioning of the police, if we were to find a violation, would have to be expunged, would have to be extirpated, would have to be thrown out of the file. And a new court, in my opinion, would have to be appointed or designated to deal with the issue without having been burdened by the findings of the previous court. I would be very grateful for the answer from both parties. Thank you.",
        "87": "Thank you, President. I note that my question is to both parties to these proceedings. I note that paragraph 5 of article 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure speaks of allowing the suspect to appoint a lawyer from the list of lawyers on duty. And at the same time, it is submitted that the applicant was never requested to pay the fees for the services of the lawyer appointed under this procedure. And at the same time, it does not seem that he was required to do so under the law. It is interesting for me to know, were these services paid at all, or were they provided pro bono? And how does this compare to the wording of paragraph 3.C of article 6, which speaks of defense through legal assistance of his own choosing, or free assistance when the interests of justice so require? How would you define the requirements of article 177 as services of own choice of a lawyer of the choosing of the applicant, or services provided for free when the interests of justice so required? Thank you.",
        "88": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is linked close to the question of Judge Kalaydjieva, and this is directed to both parties, but mainly to the government, because during government pleadings today, my attention was attracted by a statement that I couldn't find in the file. I simply did not see that, but you said, the government, that M.R., the lawyer, that he was dismissed from the police, and you related it to the potential fact that that was the reason why the applicant chose his representation, because he is aware of the structures in the investigation. My question is whether it is true that he was dismissed from his position in the police, and if yes, that when? Thank you.",
        "89": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a number of questions, some for the government, some for the applicants, and a few for both. I will put the questions first, which I think should be answered more by the government. Now, in paragraph 33 of the government's observations in connection with the complaint under Article 2, it is stated, and I quote, as to the questions concerning the end of life, in the absence of any consensus between Council of Europe member states, they, in other words, the states, must be afforded a wide margin of appreciation, unquote. Now, considering that the notion of margin of appreciation was developed in the context where states are allowed under the convention to limit, restrict, or interfere with a fundamental right, such as in Articles 5, 7, 8, 9, et cetera, and since here we are not considering the lawful execution of a sentence of a court following a conviction, how the death penalty would have been executed when it existed, of course, fell within the margin of appreciation, nor are we dealing with a deprivation of life in the circumstances as envisaged in sub-Article 2 of Article 2, could the government elaborate as to how it conceives the application of this principle of the margin of appreciation in circumstances such as the present, that is, where one has a calculated act of omission which would directly and necessarily lead to the death of a patient who would not otherwise die, but for that act of omission? I'm sorry it's a long-winded question, but that is my first question. My second question to the government is, could the government indicate exactly, it may exist in our case file, but to be honest, if it is, I have missed it completely. But could the government indicate exactly which provision of French law provides or states specifically that artificial nutrition or hydration is medical treatment? My questions to the applicant. Now, according to the preliminary draft summary of the procedure and facts, I quote from page 3, the first decision to stop feeding Mr. Lambert was taken after that, and I quote, carers had observed increasing signs in 2012 of what they believed to be resistance on his part to day-to-day care, unquote. Could the applicant's lawyers and perhaps even the parties elaborate as to whether today Mr. Lambert shows signs of excessive distress or excessive pain due either to his condition in general or to the feeding and hydration through enteral intubation in particular? Am I correct in saying that apart from certain parts of the brain and the problems with deglutition reflex, all the other organs of Mr. Lambert are functioning? Another question for the applicants. The applicant's lawyer has stated that Mrs. Lambert, the wife of Mr. Lambert, has left Reims. But before even Dr. Kariger left Reims and before Mrs. Lambert left Reims, what was the legal obstacle, if any, of transferring Mr. Lambert from the medical unit under Dr. Kariger to another medical unit which specializes in long-term care of people in similar condition? What was the legal obstacle? I have not yet understood exactly this point. And my final question to the applicants is, can the applicants clarify paragraph 125 of their written observations, particularly the words that they have underlined? I have not quite understood the significance of that paragraph and the words underlined in the context of Article 3. Now I have three sets of questions, which I think are for both parties. Does French law distinguish, for the purpose of determining whether a treatment is being carried out with unreasonable obstinacy, between ordinary and extraordinary forms of treatment? If it does, and if it exists in our case file, again, I apologize. I may have missed it. In his conclusions, the public rapporteur, Mr. Keller, referring to the debate in the French Parliament, states, and I quote from page 11, treatment should be regarded as futile, where it does not bring about any improvement in the patient's state of health. Assuming that were so, for the sake of argument, what would be the difference, in the opinion of the parties, what would be the difference, if at all, between a patient who requires renal dialysis three times a week, which is a well-known irreversible medical condition where the patient is kept alive only because of the dialysis and his condition can never improve, and the situation of a patient who is being kept alive by being fed and hydrated? My final question to both parties, and this is to make sure that I understood the French law and French procedure. Am I correct in saying that before the collective procedure is undertaken, the doctor in charge of the patient must already have come to the conclusion that the particular treatment is futile or disproportionate, or that it has no other effect than to prolong life artificially? In other words, am I correct that that is the sequence that follows? First, there is the initial decision of the doctor, and then the collective procedure is undertaken. And am I correct also in saying that this collective procedure is merely intended to advise the doctor in charge of the patient, but that he's not bound by any of the opinions he receives? Part of that question. Thank you, and I apologize for the length of those questions.",
        "90": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je souhaiterais poser une question au requ\u00e9rant, une question \u00e0 l'Etat d\u00e9fendeur, et avec votre accord, une question aux repr\u00e9sentants de la Commission de l'Union europ\u00e9enne. L'avocat du requ\u00e9rant nous a dit que le requ\u00e9rant n'avait aucune raison de penser que le jugement chypriote pouvait faire l'objet d'un recours. Mais le requ\u00e9rant a fait valoir ces griefs devant la Cour supr\u00eame de Lettonie sur le fondement de l'article 34-2 du r\u00e8glement Bruxelles 1. Or, ce texte conditionne l'examen de ces griefs \u00e0 l'exercice d'un recours contre le jugement dont l'ex\u00e9cuature est demand\u00e9e. Dans ce contexte juridique, comment le requ\u00e9rant peut-il dire qu'il n'avait aucune raison de penser qu'il convenait \u00e0 tout le moins d'\u00e9tablir un d\u00e9bat sur la possibilit\u00e9 de former un recours? Je sais que le requ\u00e9rant consid\u00e8re que les d\u00e9bats n'ont pas correspondu aux exigences de l'article 6. N\u00e9anmoins, la Cour supr\u00eame de Lettonie a jug\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9cartait les arguments de l'avocat du requ\u00e9rant. Ma question est donc la suivante. Ces arguments du requ\u00e9rant devant la Cour supr\u00eame de Lettonie traitaient-ils pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de l'impossibilit\u00e9 de former un recours \u00e0 Chypre ou \u00e9taient-elles silencieuses sur ce point? Oui. Ma derni\u00e8re question s'adresse au gouvernement d\u00e9fendeur. La Cour supr\u00eame de l'Ethonie a \u00e9cart\u00e9 les griefs du requ\u00e9rant par la motivation suivante. Je cite. Le requ\u00e9rant n'ayant pas fait appel du jugement, les arguments de son avocat selon lesquels il ne se serait pas vu d\u00fbment notifier l'examen de l'affaire par un tribunal \u00e9tranger n'ont aucune importance. Il me semble qu'il faut rappeler que l'article 34.2 du r\u00e8glement n'exclut pas le contr\u00f4le de l'Etat requis en cas d'absence de recours. Il l'exclut, je cite, lorsqu'il est \u00e9tabli que ce recours n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre de la d\u00e9cision alors qu'il \u00e9tait en mesure de le faire. Ma question est alors la suivante. Avant d'\u00e9carter les arguments du requ\u00e9rant pour ce motif, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'absence de recours, la Cour supr\u00eame a-t-elle v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 que l'appel du jugement du tribunal de Limassol devant les juridictions chypriotes \u00e9tait possible ou pour reprendre la formule de l'article 34.2, que le requ\u00e9rant \u00e9tait en mesure de le faire? Si c'est le cas, quels \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e9tablissent que cet examen a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par la Cour supr\u00eame? Si la Cour supr\u00eame estimait qu'il appartenait au requ\u00e9rant de prouver que le recours n'\u00e9tait pas possible, pourquoi n'a-t-elle pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision que le requ\u00e9rant n'avait pas apport\u00e9 la preuve qui lui incombait? Et enfin, passant du droit de l'union que notre Cour n'a pas pour mission ni pour pouvoir de contr\u00f4ler, mais passant \u00e0 l'article 6 de la Convention, est-ce que cette absence de v\u00e9rification peut poser probl\u00e8me au regard de l'article 6 de la Convention? J'ajouterai que je ne suis pas certain d'avoir parfaitement compris votre argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience, selon lequel la Cour supr\u00eame de Lettonie aurait port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l'article 36 du r\u00e8glement de Bruxelles si elle avait ouvert le d\u00e9bat sur ce point. Il me semble qu'il ne s'agissait pas de remettre en cause le jugement dont l'ex\u00e9cuature \u00e9tait demand\u00e9e, mais simplement, pour la Cour supr\u00eame, de se demander si elle pouvait ou non, au regard de l'article 34-2, \u00e9tudier les griefs du requ\u00e9rant. Enfin, ma derni\u00e8re question s'adresse aux repr\u00e9sentants de la Commission. L'article 34-2 du r\u00e8glement encadre de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s stricte le contr\u00f4le que l'Etat requis peut exercer sur le respect des droits fondamentaux par l'Etat d'origine. Dans l'hypoth\u00e8se, je dis bien dans l'hypoth\u00e8se, o\u00f9 les standards de la Convention seraient plus exigeants, l'Etat requis, qui est \u00e9galement parti \u00e0 la Convention, devrait-il s'interdire absolument de toute appr\u00e9ciation sur le fondement de la Convention? Il me semble que cette question pourrait \u00eatre utilement envisag\u00e9e \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de certains passages de l'avis de 2013 de la Cour de justice relatifs \u00e0 l'adh\u00e9sion.",
        "91": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have one question to the applicant and then one question to the Council for the Commission. As to the questio to the applicant, I would like clarification on the submission by the applicant that the court judgment in Cyprus and the court order in Latvia on the 27th of February 2006 came to his knowledge by chance. That is the way it is framed in the chamber judgment. I note, however, that in the chamber judgment, there is a verbatim citation in paragraph 16 to the Latgale District Court's granting of the applicant's request for an extension of the time limit for lodging an appeal. And there it is in the court's order stated, the court considers the circumstances to which the applicant P. Avotins refers to be established, namely the fact that he did not receive the order of 27 February until 16 June 2006. So my question is, this so-called knowledge by chance, was it by the order of 27 February 2006 being served on the applicant and also accompanied with the order of 27 February 2006, the actual Cypriot limousole court judgment? The reason I ask this is because under Article 42, paragraph 2 of the regulation of 2001, it is stated that the declaration of enforceability shall be served on the party against whom enforcement is sought accompanied by the judgment, if not already served on that party. So my question is, is this the way you received knowledge of the order of 27 February 2006? And is it clear that the Cypriot judgment itself was served in that way on the applicant? That's my question to the applicant. I have one question to the counsel for the commission, which is a clarification of some of the submissions in the written observation as orally today. Article 43, paragraph 3 of the regulation states, and I quote, the appeal shall be dealt with in accordance with the rules governing procedure in contradictory matters. Now, may I ask the council, if possible, to comment, and this is to some extent an elaboration of Judge Patotsky's question to the applicant, on whether the application of this provision of the regulation in the context of an assessment by the enforcement court of the non-recognition conditions of 34-2 would mean that if the defaulting defendant does not argue or demonstrate in any shape or form that he lacked the possibility to appeal or challenge the defaulting judgment, Article 43-3 precludes the enforcement appellate court to examine that issue on its own motion. So in other words, 43-3 limits proceedings under the regulation to purely adversarial proceedings. So arguments will not be entertained unless they are pled, and evidence being presented on whether lack of an appellate remedy in Cyprus, in this case, is forthcoming. Thank you.",
        "92": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have two factual questions to both the applicant and to the respondent government. First relates to addresses. The applicant claims that he was not given the possibility to be heard and was not summoned in proper manner. I learned from the paragraph 7 of the chamber judgment that the district court issued an order of 27 of June 2003, where he summoned the applicant to appear before the court. Then there was an affidavit declaring that the defendant was habitually resident at the address in G Street in Riga. But the reaction of the applicant was that this address was that it was objectively impossible for him to receive the summons at that address because that was only the address where he signed the loan contract and the deed of acknowledgment of the debt in 1999. And that was not his address of home or business premises. Normally, such a legal document like a contract or deed of acknowledgment as a part of precise identification of the parties of the contract also gives the address, not only the date and place when the contract or the deed of acknowledgment was signed, but in addition to the name, there should be indicated also address of business address or home address. My question is to both parties, because probably you have also government, maybe has a copy of this contract, which addresses the applicant indicated on that legal document as an address, official address, where the possible summons or the possible official communication can be served. The second question is also to both parties, because it's not for me clear enough. The deed of acknowledgment of the debt of $100,000 US was signed before the notary in May 1999. So the question is whether the applicant has paid this debt and when and in which manner. Thank you.",
        "93": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. La premi\u00e8re question s'adresse \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante. Vous avez mentionn\u00e9 dans votre expos\u00e9 oral le fait que m\u00eame si l'applicant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conscient du fait qu'apr\u00e8s 2006, il pouvait faire un recours devant les cours chypriote, cet recours, \u00e0 votre avis, ne pouvait pas mener \u00e0 une voie effective pour l'applicant. Ca veut dire qu'il y avait une possibilit\u00e9 que le recours soit exclu par les cours Chypriote. Ma question est, est-ce que la partie recurrente a vraiment su, a vraiment agi dans la direction de formuler un tel recours et il avait des r\u00e9ticences par rapport \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'aboutir \u00e0 cet recours ou vraiment la partie r\u00e9currente est rest\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s 2006 jusqu'\u00e0 2007 dans une certaine passivit\u00e9 comme les autres parties l'invoquent ici? Ma deuxi\u00e8me question est li\u00e9e au probl\u00e8me de la question pr\u00e9liminaire que vous dites que la Cour supr\u00eame de la Lettonie devait mettre par rapport \u00e0 cette question. D'apr\u00e8s ce que j'ai compris, vous avez dit que cette question pr\u00e9liminaire, \u00e0 votre avis, \u00e9tait obligatoire dans ce jugement particulier parce que, de votre avis, il n'y avait pas une d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Luxembourg qui \u00e9tait relevante \u00e0 ce cas avant 2006. Donc, je voulais voir votre raisonnement par rapport \u00e0 la question pr\u00e9liminaire. Vous pensez que quand on a affaire au r\u00e8glement de Bruxelles 1, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il faut avoir une question pr\u00e9liminaire ou il faut avoir une question pr\u00e9liminaire seulement si on n'a pas, comme vous avez dit, une d\u00e9cision claire \u00e0 cet avis, une d\u00e9cision qui est ressemblable aux d\u00e9cisions que la Cour supr\u00eame de l'\u00c9tat doit faire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette affaire. L'autre question, si vous me pertenez, M. le Pr\u00e9sident, est aussi mise \u00e0 la ti\u00e8de partie intervenante \u00e0 la Commission. Et je voulais vous demander une question plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, maintenant, qui tient \u00e0 l'application de notre consid\u00e9ration de Bosphorus qui \u00e9tait invoqu\u00e9e par tous les partis ici. Comme vous le connaissez tr\u00e8s bien, dans notre arr\u00eat de Bosphorus, nous avons invoqu\u00e9 une disposition de la Charte de l'Union europ\u00e9enne pour la protection des droits de l'homme et notamment de l'article 52, alin\u00e9a 3, qui fait partie aux conditions minimales qui, au niveau de protection conventionnelle, \u00e9tait le minimum qui \u00e9tait respect\u00e9 dans le droit de l'Union europ\u00e9enne. Comment est-ce qu'\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la jurisprudence post\u00e9rieure de notre arr\u00eat Bosphorus, de la Cour de justice de l'Union europ\u00e9enne, et comment est-ce qu'\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l'opinion de 2013, est-ce que vous voyez aujourd'hui que cette condition minimale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise par nous en Bosphorus \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque peut \u00eatre encore consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par notre Cour, notamment par rapport \u00e0 tous les consid\u00e9rants au principe de confiance mutuelle que l'opinion de 2013 nous a fait faire connaissance? Je vous remercie, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "94": "Thank you, President. I have a question to both parties. I have heard today and read previously in the document the term status, the status of religious faiths in Turkey. There has been talk of official status and talk of legal status, \"statut juridique\". On the other hand, I have heard that Turkey is a secular state. There is not even a registration of faiths in Turkey. So I am a bit confused about the use of status as regards religious faiths in Turkey. And I would be glad if the parties could enlighten me. Thank you.",
        "95": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have altogether four questions that I would like to put. Two of them, first of all, for the applicants. Could you provide some more description on the specific religious needs for the Alevi faith and the manner in which those needs are met and managed, would be my first question. And the second question, in practice, what are the implications of this rejection of your request by the authorities? What are the practical implications on the religious practice of your faith ever since that your request has been rejected by the authorities? Could you give us some concrete examples on this? For example, what is the status of Alevi dignitaries, and are there any difficulties? We heard a little bit about it, but I would like you to elaborate it regarding the building of cemevis in Turkey at the moment. Now for the government. Your government has submitted, and you have mentioned this today in the hearing, that between June 2009 and January 2010, seven Alevi workshops were organized in Turkey with a view to examining questions relating to the Alevi community in the context of the Alevi initiative. And the final report of these workshops was adopted following those meetings and presented by the Prime Minister. And this report lists the measures that the state should consider for social peace. I'm referring in particular to 30 subchapters, pages 189 until 194 of the report. Since 2010, what are the concrete measures that have been adopted following these roundtables? The applicant party may also comment on this issue. We have heard so far today at the hearing only about the changes in the curriculum of the religious culture and ethics courses or classes, which even more need to be improved after the judgment of this court, Mansur Yal\u00e7\u0131n versus Turkey. But what are the other, if any, concrete measures that have been adopted since then? And my final question, Mr. President, would be for two parties to answer. I have some difficulties understanding about the position of the law number 677 in Turkey, which actually ordered the closure of mystical tradition places and made it an offense to provide venues for ceremonies by mystical religion's orders. It also prohibited the use of certain titles connected with those institutions, such as dede, which we have heard today, the title used by the Alevi spiritual leaders, and the practices linked to those titles. I also note that actually the administrative court in its decision of 4th of June 2007 cited this law without drawing any conclusions about it. But you have mentioned the government's representatives today that this law has not been applied, but the law exists. What is the relationship between the legal certainty in this respect? Could we consider that this law could be the main obstacle, legal obstacle, in recognizing a status for cemevis or the religious practices of the Alevi community? So if you could provide me a little bit more clarification on that. Thank you very much.",
        "96": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question \u00e0 poser aux deux partis. Sans doute que, comme les partis ont affirm\u00e9, il ne s'agit pas aujourd'hui pour nous de faire un d\u00e9bat th\u00e9ologique. Mais quand m\u00eame, dans la doctrine, il y a beaucoup de diff\u00e9rences concernant les d\u00e9finitions d'al\u00e9visme. Je voulais savoir exactement o\u00f9 les deux partis se situent par rapport \u00e0 ces d\u00e9finitions qui existent dans la doctrine concernant l'al\u00e9visme. Et vous le savez tr\u00e8s bien que, dans le fameux livre \u00e9crit par Massikar, qui se r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux al\u00e9vies en Turquie et en Europe, Massikar d\u00e9finit l'al\u00e9visme comme un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne religieux, mais aussi, il dit \u00e0 un certain moment qu'al\u00e9visme peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme une pratique qui est pour la d\u00e9fense de la d\u00e9mocratie. Dans le m\u00eame livre, il affirme que l'al\u00e9visme aussi, il a des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui viennent de zoroastrisme, il vient de chamanisme, donc pas seulement de soufisme qu'ici a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 par les deux partis. Donc voil\u00e0 une vision d'un livre qui, quand m\u00eame, domine aujourd'hui la compr\u00e9hension religieuse de l'al\u00e9visme. Il y a aussi un autre livre qui est important, \u00e9crit par Hargrave Jennings, qui parle aussi de l'al\u00e9visme et cette fois-ci, il lit l'al\u00e9visme en question de musulmans chias. Donc voil\u00e0, il combine aussi les pratiques chias, comme Jennings dit, avec des autres pratiques qui viennent des autres religions musulmanes. Et je voulais savoir exactement, parce qu'il semble qu'il y a des diff\u00e9rences, m\u00eame si notre d\u00e9bat, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te encore une fois, n'est pas un d\u00e9bat th\u00e9ologique, comment est-ce que vous vous placez par rapport \u00e0 ces d\u00e9finitions qui existent dans la doctrine? Ma deuxi\u00e8me question est li\u00e9e surtout au gouvernement. Parce que le gouvernement nous avait expliqu\u00e9 quelles mesures sont prises concernant cette protection des minorit\u00e9s en Turquie. On a beaucoup parl\u00e9 ici sur le trait\u00e9 de Lausanne et quelles sont les minorit\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnues par le trait\u00e9 de Lausanne et quelles sont les minorit\u00e9s qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnues par le trait\u00e9 de Lausanne et quelles sont les cons\u00e9quences sur ces minorit\u00e9s. Je voulais savoir comment est-ce que le gouvernement se place aujourd'hui par rapport aux rapports qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9s, pas seulement par la Commission de Venise, que vous \u00eates au courant, mais aussi par rapport aux rapports qui sont formul\u00e9s par la Commission europ\u00e9enne tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment, en 2011, en 2012, en 2013. Et ces rapports tous, ils parlent sur la question de discrimination par rapport aux minorit\u00e9s qui sont musulmanes en Turquie. Et je voulais savoir quelles mesures vous pensez prendre par rapport \u00e0 tout ce type de rapports qui existent. Je vous remercie, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "97": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to ask the government concerning the scholarly opinion submitted to the court. In this distinguished document on page one, the following statement is to be found. According to the general classification accepted within religious studies, religious groups consist of three primary structures, namely religions, sects, and mystical formations. And then this is used throughout the whole document and probably reflects an underlying consideration for the way religious groups are considered. And there, this is a system kind of hierarchy. Now, my question concerns only the first, the third, the fourth and fifth words. This is a general classification accepted within religious studies. It's not a question about theology. It's about a question on structures. And it is very surprising to read this. There are no footnotes. And it is common knowledge that, at least in the English-speaking world, churches and sects are not treated the way it is here, beginning with Max Weber, if I'm not mistaken. I mean, this is common knowledge. The two are just different because of inclusiveness and intensity. And this was then taken up by Truch. And then last time I had to deal with these matters, the prevailing position was Stark and Bainbridge, who concluded that this distinction empirically is not sustainable anymore because it is a total overlap, a matter of gradation. It's not two distinct categories. And anyway, even if distinct, as it's in the ideal type of Weber, they are not in a relationship of hierarchy. So once again, my question is related to the structures, not theology. We are not dealing here with theology. There was general understanding in that regard. It's about organization of religious life. And I just wonder how the statement here, that this is an accepted typology, fits into what I thought so far is at least a most respected approach in structuring, in understanding religious structures, namely Max Weber until Stark. So my question is how your position fits into that tradition. So is this really the only possible consideration of the problem? Thank you.",
        "98": "Oui, merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai d'abord 2 questions pour le gouvernement. \u00c7a concerne l'arr\u00eat du tribunal administratif du 4 juillet 2007. Alors, dans cette d\u00e9cision, le tribunal administratif d'Ankara a rejet\u00e9 la demande des requ\u00e9rants pour 2 motifs. Tout d'abord, il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le refus de l'administration oppos\u00e9e aux demandes des requ\u00e9rants \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation. Alors, en vertu de la Constitution, article 136 de la Constitution, la direction des affaires religieuses, qui fait partie de l'administration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, remplit les fonctions qui lui sont confi\u00e9es en vertu de la loi sp\u00e9cifique, conform\u00e9ment aux principes de la\u00efcit\u00e9. De m\u00eame, selon l'article 1er de la loi 633, la direction des affaires religieuses est charg\u00e9e de traiter des affaires religieuses dans le domaine des croyances, du culte et de la morale de l'islam. Alors, vu ces deux dispositions, on peut consid\u00e9rer que la direction est charg\u00e9e de fournir un service religieux \u00e0 l'ensemble des musulmans, y compris aux personnes adh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 d'autres ou diverses interpr\u00e9tations de l'islam. Alors, comment expliquez-vous que le tribunal a jug\u00e9 le refus de l'administration de la demande des requ\u00e9rants conforme \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation en vigueur? En deuxi\u00e8me lieu, le tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de donner une suite favorable \u00e0 la demande des requ\u00e9rants sans revoir la l\u00e9gislation. Est-ce que la l\u00e9gislation doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e pour satisfaire aux demandes des requ\u00e9rants? Et dans l'affirmative, si oui, alors dans quel sens? Ma deuxi\u00e8me question pour le gouvernement concerne l'avis de la Commission de Venise, adopt\u00e9 en 2014. C'est un avis qui concerne les lignes directrices sur la personnalit\u00e9 juridique des communaut\u00e9s religieuses. Alors, dans cet avis, la Commission de Venise a essay\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir un document de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9non\u00e7ant les normes internationales minimales en mati\u00e8re de justice et minimales en mati\u00e8re de reconnaissance des communaut\u00e9s religieuses ou de convictions. Alors, je voudrais savoir la position du gouvernement vis-\u00e0-vis de cet avis. Ma deuxi\u00e8me question concerne les deux parties, alors pour les requ\u00e9rants aussi. On a abord\u00e9 ce sujet, mais il faut pr\u00e9ciser de plus. Les services religieux relatifs \u00e0 la religion musulmane ont le statut de service public en Turquie. Donc, par cons\u00e9quent, le service public religieux d\u00e9pend du r\u00e9gime juridique du service public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Donc, comment peut-on concilier ce syst\u00e8me avec le principe d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant le service public et le principe de neutralit\u00e9 du service public toujours? Merci beaucoup.",
        "99": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is prompted by the relative silence of the government towards the already existing case law of the court. This is not the first case in which the European Court of Human Rights has dealt with the Alevi community in Turkey. As mentioned by the applicants, in December, the second section of this court gave judgment in the case of Kumur Yeci. If I recall correctly, the government requested a referral of this case to the Grand Chamber. This was rejected in April. In this case, as correctly mentioned by the applicant, the second section found that the cemevi Center in Yenibosna should have been considered in the same way as other recognized places of worship, a place of worship of the religious conviction involved. The reason I ask this is that one of the four concrete demands which are before this court in this case, and perhaps the most concrete one, which was rejected by the administrative tribunal for reasons related to law number 633 and Article 128 of the Constitution, was the impossibility of recognizing the cemevi as a place of worship. And in the judgment in Kumur Yeci, the legal consequences of such non-recognitions are presented. So my question is this. Is the government here today inviting the Grand Chamber to re-examine the assessment made and the findings of the second section, which were not brought before the Grand Chamber? And I would ask that a position on this issue be made as clear as possible. And if so, does the government then reject the findings of the second section? And on what basis? Thank you.",
        "100": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais \u00e9galement poser une question, surtout au gouvernement, mais les requ\u00e9rants peuvent r\u00e9pondre aussi, une question qui est suscit\u00e9e par le jugement du tribunal d'Ankara, le tribunal administratif d'Ankara, qui a rejet\u00e9 la demande des requ\u00e9rants en disant, \u00e0 la fin de son jugement notamment, que si l'\u00c9tat r\u00e9pondait sous la forme d'un service public \u00e0 chacune des attentes et des demandes des requ\u00e9rants, alors il y aurait un risque de distance avec le principe de l'\u00c9tat la\u00efc et un risque que les libert\u00e9s de religion et de croyance seraient r\u00e9duites, seraient limit\u00e9es, de sorte que la paix civile serait mise en p\u00e9ril. Est-ce que le gouvernement est d'accord avec ce point de vue du tribunal? Et est-ce qu'il pourrait expliquer en quoi consisterait surtout le risque pour la jouissance de libert\u00e9 de religion et de croyance quand on va donner pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 une tendance qui s'appelle une religion des avantages qu'on donne aussi \u00e0 une autre tendance?",
        "101": "Pr\u00e9sident, j'ai deux questions \u00e0 poser au gouvernement. Un argument majeur du gouvernement fran\u00e7ais, ayant demand\u00e9 le renvoi de l'affaire devant la grande chambre, r\u00e9side dans l'incertitude qui aurait pr\u00e9tendument \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la mani\u00e8re dont la Chambre a utilis\u00e9 le concept du sujet d'un drait g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Pour expliquer l'absence d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 la publication en cause, le gouvernement a indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait impossible qu'Alexandre puisse pr\u00e9tendre au tr\u00f4ne au regard de la constitution de principaut\u00e9 de Monaco. Le gouvernement fran\u00e7ais, tout comme les juridictions nationales, ont estim\u00e9 qu'Alexandre Coste ne pouvait pr\u00e9tendre au tr\u00f4ne car il \u00e9tait n\u00e9 hors des liens du mariage. Toutefois, d'un point de vue purement l\u00e9gal, cette circonstance ne semblait pas d\u00e9cisive. D'un point de vue l\u00e9gal, \u00e0 la date de la publication litigieuse et au moment o\u00f9 les juridictions internes se sont prononc\u00e9es, et bien que cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 puisse para\u00eetre totalement improbable, le fils de Mme Coste et du prince de Monaco aurait pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9tendant au tr\u00f4ne en cas de l\u00e9gitimation par le mariage de ses parents biologiques, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la constitution et au code civil de Monaco. Le gouvernement peut-il expliquer sur quels fondements l\u00e9gaux il parvient \u00e0 une opinion diff\u00e9rente en la mati\u00e8re? Deuxi\u00e8me question. La publication dans Paris Match concerne une interview de Mme Coste. Les juridictions internes ont estim\u00e9 que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9ditrice et la directrice des publications en \u00e9taient responsables. Selon le gouvernement, cela aurait-il fait une diff\u00e9rence si Mme Coste avait publi\u00e9 sa biographie et celle de son fils dans un article qu'elle aurait elle-m\u00eame r\u00e9dig\u00e9? En d'autres termes, le contenu de l'interview \u00e9tait-il tel que les devoirs et responsabilit\u00e9s de l'\u00e9diteur impliquaient une intervention active, pas seulement au regard du droit du public d'\u00eatre inform\u00e9 des questions relevant de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, mais \u00e9galement contre le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression de Mme Coste afin de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e du prince Albert II de Monaco? Les juridictions nationales auraient-elles d\u00fb \u00e9galement donner du poids au droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d'expression de Mme Coste dans la mise en balance des droits en jeu? Merci.",
        "102": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. Just following up on Judge Silvis's question, I have one question to the government. The government, in its referral request, firstly and foremostly emphasizes that the Fifth Section's judgment wrongly interpreted the concept of a contribution to a debate of generalists and it opened the way for considerable judicial uncertainty, that is the crux of the referral request. May I ask, and the government of course follows this up in its brief and here orally by inviting the court not to substitute its own judgment for the assessment of the domestic courts, namely the court of cassation, referring to our classic expressions in our case law that if the balancing of interest has been performed by the domestic courts in accordance with the criteria in our case law, it is not for this court, unless it has strong reasons, to substitute its assessment. It is on this basis that I would like the government to clarify its statements in paragraph 70 and 71 of the observations, where in paragraph 70, the government refers to the court of cassation's reasoning in the case. This is also developed at paragraph 24 of the chamber judgment, where the court of cassation noted that on the date on which the article was published, the child's existence and his family relationship were unknown to the public. And that the principality's constitution rules out the possibility of his accession to the throne since he was born outside a wedlock, a situation that moreover, and I quote, the company did not allege to be a subject of debate in French or Monegasque society or of examination in the impugned publication. Do I understand the government's pleading correctly as inviting the court then firstly to formulate this concept of what constitutes a contribution to a debate in the public interest or in the general interest in such a way that a debate on this subject matter must be already ongoing, must be already ongoing for the condition to apply? And secondly, that the article in question must primarily or its core feature must be the examination of the issue that is alleged to be forming a contribution in the public interest? Because I understand the government saying it agrees with the assessment of the court of cassation. And if that is the view of the government, may I ask the government kindly to refer to a case of this court that would support that kind of formulation of the issue of the concept of a contribution in the general interest? Thank you.",
        "103": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Juste une question de suivi et une clarification que, cette fois-ci, s'adresse \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante. On sait des pi\u00e8ces de dossier que l'enfant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu quatre mois apr\u00e8s sa naissance chez le notaire. Vous avez pourtant invoqu\u00e9 le fait que la reconnaissance de l'enfant, cette fois-ci la reconnaissance, vous dites, publique de l'enfant, aurait des d\u00e9lais dans lesquels elle aurait pu \u00eatre faite. \u00c7a veut dire qu'au moment, en 2005, quand Madame Coste avait donn\u00e9 cette interview, on s'approchait d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, selon vous, de ce d\u00e9lai. De quoi exactement il s'agit? Est-ce qu'il y a un d\u00e9lai pour ce type de reconnaissance? Et quelles sont les cons\u00e9quences? Est-ce qu'il y a des cons\u00e9quences juridiques pour ce type de reconnaissance par rapport \u00e0 la reconnaissance que d\u00e9j\u00e0 Albert de Monaco avait fait devant le notaire, comme les pi\u00e8ces de dossier l'ont dit? Merci beaucoup.",
        "104": "Thank you, Mr. President. This question is addressed to the government, but of course the other parties may comment. Allow me to quote the Italian Constitutional Court in its decision number 49 from 2015. It is the Italian Constitutional Court speaking. In other words, the Italian Constitutional Court said in this judgment that the judgments of this court are only binding as precedent for the Italian courts when they are diritto consolidato, meaning what we usually call WECL, well-established case law, or pilot judgments. Now, my question is the following. Would the government mind to comment this position of the Italian Constitutional Court in the light of the Brighton Conference commitments that member states undertook, and namely that they guarantee, and I quote, the full implementation of the convention at the national level, which requires state parties to take effective measures to prevent violations, and that to that end, all state parties and more generally all public authorities should discharge their responsibilities in a way that gives full effect to the convention, end of quote. Is the Italian Constitutional Court's decision an informal reservation to this convention? Does Italy intend to make a reservation to the effect of the judgments of this court when they are not diritto consolidato? I put this question in these terms because the government is certainly aware that this possibility has been discussed in the intensive debate in the Italian doctrine caused by the Constitutional Court's judgment number 49. Thank you very much.",
        "105": "Le Pr\u00e9sident, en fait, ma premi\u00e8re question \u00e9tait celle de M. Pinto de Albuquerque, mais je vais la poser d'une mani\u00e8re un peu diff\u00e9rente qu'il l'a fait. D'ailleurs, la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9e d'une certaine mani\u00e8re par l'opinion en partie concordante commune des juges Casadevall, Raimondi, Bahr, Nicola et Dedov dans l'arr\u00eat Paris contre l'Italie, o\u00f9 les juges montrent comment la pratique a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e depuis les arr\u00eats qui \u00e9taient nomm\u00e9s jumeaux 30, 40, 48 et 39 de 2007 \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat qu'il a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 49 de 2015, \u00e0 laquelle a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence mon coll\u00e8gue, monsieur le juge Pinto de Albuquerque. Je voulais aussi savoir, parce que j'ai un peu une autre question diff\u00e9rente que mon coll\u00e8gue avait mis. Je suis devant moi la sentence de la juge de la cour en italien et ici on marque une pr\u00e9sence de una diritto consolidata ou de una sentenza pilota. Donc je veux savoir exactement qu'est-ce que vous comprenez par diritto consolidata, parce que je vois que l'arr\u00eat pilote c'est une cat\u00e9gorie diff\u00e9rente dans cet arr\u00eat de la cour de concionelle qui ne pr\u00e9occupe et qui \u00e9tait en partie expliqu\u00e9e par cette opinion en partie concordante commune des juges que j'ai cit\u00e9s auparavant. J'ai une deuxi\u00e8me question \u00e0 mettre, qui est adress\u00e9e au gouvernement, mais aussi au requ\u00e9rant. Quelle \u00e9tait la disposition du code de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ils avaient le non-lieu par rapport au requ\u00e9rant qui \u00e9tait avec le non-lieu? \u00c7a veut dire pas la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G.I.E.M. qui se trouve dans une autre situation, les autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Est-ce que c'\u00e9tait possible que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s que la cour d\u00e9cide qu'il y a la prescription, exige de la part de la cour de continuer le proc\u00e8s p\u00e9nal pour \u00e9tablir qu'ils ne sont pas, pour les acquitter finalement, qu'ils \u00e9tablissent qu'ils ne sont pas responsables? Il y avait cette possibilit\u00e9 dans le droit de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale italien ou non? Parce que selon les actes qu'on a maintenant devant nous, le code de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale italien, l'article 129, on dit que m\u00eame si la prescription est acquise, le juge doit quand m\u00eame acquitter l'accus\u00e9 sur le fond, ce ressemble manifestement au dossier que l'accus\u00e9 n'a pas commis les faits r\u00e9proch\u00e9s, sauf les faits n'ont pas eu lieu. Il faut en en sous-exister que l'infraction n'est pas constitu\u00e9e ou que les faits ne rel\u00e8vent pas du droit p\u00e9nal. Mais ma question est un peu diff\u00e9rente. Sauf cette hypoth\u00e8se, il y avait la possibilit\u00e9 pour le requ\u00e9rant de demander que le juge continue le proc\u00e8s pour \u00e9tablir qu'ils ne sont pas coupables ou non dans le code de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale. Et \u00e7a s'agit du gouvernement et aussi au requ\u00e9rant que j'ai mis cette question. Je vous remercie Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "106": "My question is addressed mostly to the applicant companies Hotel Promotion, R.I.T.A. Sarda and Falgest. In the Eastern cases, these applicant companies were not parties to criminal proceedings of any kind and only a physical person, that is, the legal representatives of these companies, Hotel Promotion and Falgest, and two associates of Rita Sarda were committed for trial. Now, the question is, did these accused physical persons, as representatives of the applicant companies, have received from these companies sufficient legal powers or legal authorization to perform the site development which was declared illegal? Or, on the contrary, did this physical person act ultra vires, that is, did they act without legal power or legal authorization from the companies they were representing? Thank you.",
        "107": "Thank you, President. My question goes to the representative of the government, but as other judges, I also invite other parties' representatives to tell their views on this question. I spring from the government's position that the confiscation which is dealt with in this case is not a criminal sanction by its nature and is only applied by a criminal court. So I would like to know whether this non-criminal sanction applied by a criminal court is a typical phenomenon in the Italian legal system, or is it an exception? And in particular, are there any other, and if so, how many, non-criminal sanctions in the Italian legal system that are applied by criminal courts and especially under the criminal procedure law? If you could provide a list or at least some examples that could be confirmed by statutory law, by the court's case law, or at least by the legal doctrine, thank you.",
        "108": "Thank you, President. I have a question to both parties. It concerns the issue of self-defense before us today, self-defense of the officers of the unit of SO19 who were deployed on 22nd of July, 2005, and who eventually killed Mr. de Menezes. It concerns the briefing of these officers. When they reported on 22nd of July, 2005, at 0745 to duty, they were briefed as follows. I have this from the documents before us. First, they were told that they might be required to use unusual tactics. When asked for clarification, the briefing went on. I quote from the documents, if they were deployed to intercept a subject and there was an opportunity to challenge, but the subject was noncompliant, a critical shot could be taken, end of quote. My question concerns these instructions at the briefing, according to which the special firearms officers were instructed to shoot to kill, critical headshot. I would like to know the party's views on whether this briefing, in fact, permitted the special firearms officers to differentiate, differentiate, to react proportionally, in particular, whether the special firearms officers could have employed less far-reaching means, namely nonlethal shots, which could have prevented the presumed suicide attack while not killing Mr de Menezes. Thank you.",
        "109": "Thank you, Mr. President. My questions are to the government. Is the UK government aware that Article 31c of the Rome Statute, which was, by the way, the subject of extensive negotiations, and is today considered as customary international law, is the UK government aware that this provision warrants that the person acts reasonably, I'm quoting from the provision, reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person and in a manner proportionate to the degree of real present danger to the person attacked or the third person? Is the government of the UK aware of the UN basic principles on the use of force by law enforcement officials, which provide that intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve this objective, and that in any case, officials should exercise restraint in such use in proportion to the seriousness of the offense? Is the UK government aware that the UN Code of Conduct for law enforcement officials, as well as the OSCE guidebook on the democratic policing, also require that self-defense be not only proportionate, but reasonable and unavoidable? Final question, is the UK government aware of these universal standards, according to which the test for self-defense is based on a crucial, necessary, objective element of reasonableness of the belief of an imminent attack, or does the government of the UK consider that it is not bound by any of these universal standards, including those set by customary international law? Thank you very much.",
        "110": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have one question to the government. You repeatedly invoke the margin of appreciation doctrine. Article 2 is an underrogable right. Do you believe that margin of appreciation is applicable in relation to such a provision? And if yes, to which extent? Thank you very much.",
        "111": "My question to both parties concerns the application presented to the High Court by the applicant for judicial review of the initial decision of the director of public prosecution, the decision not to prosecute any individual police officer. The High Court, a division of High Court, based its dismissal of this application on the so-called Manning test, derived from the case R versus the director of public prosecution, Ex parte Manning, which seems to have been decisive in this case. According to this case law in Manning, a court would accord great weight to the judgment of experienced prosecutors concerning prosecution decisions. Now, my question is, up to what point does this Manning case law represent an impediment or a strong difficulty for the courts to review DPP decisions? Is there a presumption in favor of the DPP decisions? In that case, what is the extent, what is the intensity of this presumption? Up to what point in practice the courts are bound to follow the DPP initial decision to prosecute, or, as is the case here, not to prosecute? What is the strength of this presumption? Thank you.",
        "112": "Thank you, President. I have two questions to the government, but of course, if the applicant wish to comment, he can do so. My first question relates to applicability of Article 6. It appears that claiming that the first condition of the Escalinan test, namely the explicit exclusion of access to court, has been met. Your government relied heavily on the fact that the applicant's dismissal had been written into the fundamental law itself, namely transitional provisions of the fundamental law, and was therefore not subject to any form of judicial review. I would like to refer, however, to the decision of your constitutional court, number 45, 2012, of 28 December 2012, in which the constitutional court concluded as follows. I quote, the constitutional court possesses, beyond doubt, the competence to proceed with reviewing transitional provisions of the fundamental law in whole and in parts on formal grounds with regard to its validity, invalidity, under public law, irrespectively to the fact whether transitional provisions of the fundamental law is or is not part of the fundamental law. I would like to ask you to clarify your position in light of this decision by the constitutional court. And my second question relates to the undertaking by your government to the Venice Commission in July 2011. Again, I quote, Hungary assures the commission that the drafting of transitional provisions will not be used to unduly put an end to the terms of office of persons elected under the previous legal regime. I wonder if this undertaking's set times included the applicant or not. Thank you very much.",
        "113": "Thank you, Mr. President. My two questions addressed to the government, but of course, the applicant can also comment on them. The first one is on a point of Hungarian constitutional law. Professor and judge Otto Bachof in 1951 wrote a marvelous text on a for fast ones, \"Verfassungswidrige Verfassungsnormen\", meaning unconstitutional constitutional norms. My point is the following. Uh, what is the situation with regard to Hungarian constitutional law? Uh, does, uh, the constitutional law and the constitutional doctrine, um, uh, in Hungary acknowledge the possibility that there might be norms in the constitution that are unconstitutional. For instance, imagine that a reform of the constitution provides for a suspension of in a mobility of a part of the judiciary. Would that, uh, law enshrined, uh, through the means of a transitional provision, for instance, in the constitution be valid? My second question, uh, is related to, uh, section 114 of the organization and administration of the courts act. These provision established a new criterion for the election of the new president, which led to the eligibility of the former president of the Supreme court as president of the courier. This criterion referred to the time served as a judge in Hungary, not counting the time served as a judge in the European court, for instance. Now, Mr. Baka, the applicant served these courts 17 years from 1991 to 2008. We are today that the position of the garment is that a career of 17 years in this court, in the European court of human rights as the one of Mr. Baka is not of equal value as the career for the same period of time in the domestic courts, I would like to hear the reasons I would like that the government clarified the reasons why this career of 17 years here at the court is not of the same value of a career at the national courts. I'm not sure if I understood correctly the point of the government when it referred to the discussion, the ongoing discussion in the, um, council of Europe on the independence of the judges of the European court. I'm not sure if I understood correctly that the government of Hungary doubts about the independence of these judges, of the judges of this court, that the judges of this court are not politically independent. And that was the reason why the career of 17 years of Mr. Baca was not of equal value of a career of a judge in the domestic courts for the same period. I would like the government to clarify if that is the position, um, that was presented because I did not really understand the point of the government when it referred to the ongoing discussion in the council of Europe about the independence and the reinforcement of the independence of the judges of the European court. Thank you very much.",
        "114": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to ask a question to both parties. And the question is somewhat prompted by something that was mentioned by counsel for the applicant about the possibility for judges to bring claims before the service tribunal. I would like to ask what would be the situation in, legal situation in two somewhat different situations than the one that we are discussing today. One is, the first one is the situation where a judge, an individual judge would be considered to be no longer suitable for the job. What sort of a suitability could be mentioned? Illness, would this also include political insuitability? Would that be a reason to take action against a judge? And my question here would be in particular, what would be the competent body to take action? And would there be any possibility of judicial review? And the second situation is the one of an alleged, in inappropriate conduct of a judge, a conduct of a judge that is incompatible with judicial ethics. Would it be possible to bring disciplinary proceedings against the judge? And if so, what would then be the competent body? And would there be a possibility of judicial review? I repeat, I realize that these are not the situations in this case, but to get a broader picture, I would like to know what would happen in these two situations. Thank you.",
        "115": "Thank you, President. I would have two questions to the government, please. One question concerns Article 49, Paragraph 4 of the Act on Parliament, on which the sanctions in this case were based, which provides or which it's necessary to state a conduct that is gravely offensive to the authority of the parliament. And I wanted to ask how it's defined that a conduct is gravely offensive, not only offensive. Which criteria are used to determine the gravity of the disturbance, a length of time of the disturbance, number of people involved, size of billboards, deprivation of the rights of others? And if I understood the agent of the government correctly, also previously exhibited conduct. I just want to know which criteria are applied. And the second question is closely linked to the first one. Is it necessary for such a sanction to be reasoned on the basis of Section 49, Paragraph 4 and 49, Paragraph 7 of the Act on Parliament? In the case at hand, it was explained why the amounts of the sanctions were differentiated according to the status of the MPs. But it was not explained otherwise why it was considered that there was a gravely offensive conduct, gravely offensive to the authority of the parliament. Thank you.",
        "116": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is directed to both parties. As it results from the dossier, the fines to the applicants were proposed by the Speaker of the House several days after the facts, and these fines were approved without debate by the plenary of the parliament. My question is whether within this disciplinary proceedings within parliament, whether the applicant has any effective possibility to state their position or adducing any arguments in the defense or challenging the charge formulated by the Speaker before the final decision by the plenary of the House. The government has made some passing reference to this point, but I would appreciate some precision of whether this possibility were effective. I know that there was a reform of the law last year on this matter, but my question refers to the situation in the moment of the fact discussed in this case, that is, in the spring of 2013. Thank you.",
        "117": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions, and one question concerns a clarification. But my first question concerns the government. My question to the government is about the scope of the possible retroactive effect of the court's judgments. After the Vinter judgment, it's clear that life sentences, if proportionate to the facts, can only be in conformity with Article 3 of the Convention if the life sentence is de facto and de jure reducible. There is a longstanding position on the part of the court concerning cases in which the applicants have already lodged a complaint with the court at the time of the reversal of case law. As they are in exactly the same position as the successful applicant, they should be treated in the same way. So one of the differences between the Vinter position and Murray is that at the moment, the court may have to deal with the merits of this case. There has been a significant change in the law of Cura\u00e7ao by the introduction of the review system. Now, the government states that the pardon system is already in conformity with the Vinter criteria, if I understand you well. But perhaps you may explain why, when introducing the review system, the arguments for introducing this system were to bring the legislation in conformity with current standards of human rights. Was it necessary to introduce this new system if the old system already met the criteria? Perhaps you would like to elaborate on this. Now, my question to the applicants. One very small but perhaps important point is the representative of the government stated that there is a pardons act. And the representative of the government also stated that that was not in line with the position presented by the applicant, because the applicant referred to the Constitution in which there is a basis for a pardon request. Perhaps you could explain whether there is a difference on this legal point between the government and the representative of the applicant. The point of clarification is this. Listening to your intervention, you refer to an observation of the CPT, the Committee on the Prevention of Torture, observing in 2013 an incapacity culture in the prison institutions in the Antilles. However, in 2013, the CPT has not visited the Antilles. There is, however, and I think you are referring to this observation report, there is an observation report of two experts assigned by the Dutch government which relates indeed to the CPT observations from 2007 reported in 2008. And according to these experts, there are shortcomings, especially in relation to the promotion of sensible activities for the inmates. And in this context, they note that the guards are trained to keep control and order, but they are not equipped in the process of re-socialization. Is that the observation you have in mind when expressing that there is an incapacity culture in the prisons of the Antilles, more specifically in the Correctional Institute in Aruba? Perhaps you may clarify this issue. Thank you.",
        "118": "Thank you, Mr. President. Both parties have in their pleadings before the Grand Chamber addressed the importance of the principle of rehabilitation as recognized in this court's case law. It has been mentioned that the convicted person should know what he must do to rehabilitate himself in order to have the prospect of release. It has also been mentioned that the convicted person should be allowed to rehabilitate himself in order to have the prospect of release. In other words, it has been argued that the state should not hinder the convicted person from rehabilitating himself. This may, in my view, be seen as a negative obligation on the state following from Article III, not to hinder but to allow. At the same time, it has been argued today that the state has to provide the convicted person with necessary treatment. This may, in my view, be seen as a positive obligation on the state to rehabilitate the convicted person, to rehabilitate or to assume responsibility for the rehabilitation of the convicted person. My question to the parties concerned these two aspects of the principle of rehabilitation, the positive and the negative aspect. In the view of the parties, taking into account the court's case law, is it necessary to make a distinction between these two aspects of the principle of rehabilitation? In other words, are they on an equal footing should the rights of the applicant and the obligation of the state be treated on an equal footing? Thank you.",
        "119": "I have two questions for the government, but of course the applicant may also elaborate on these questions. The applicant has said that no plan for the rehabilitation of James Murray has ever been prepared by the prison authorities who took care of him. The applicant has also said that it is the policy of the Kingdom of Netherlands that all life prisoners do not qualify for activities aiming at rehabilitation. And the applicant has even quoted the Dutch Secretary for Justice and Security. My two questions are the following. First, can you confirm that it is the policy of the Kingdom of Netherlands that all life prisoners do not qualify for activities aiming at reintegration, as Mr. Teeven has said? Second, can you confirm that no plan for the rehabilitation of James Murray was ever prepared during the time he spent in prison, over 30 years?",
        "120": "Thank you, Mr. President. One very, very short question for government. Which were the main reasons, I would say compelling reasons, made the transfer of applicant unfeasible in the realm of Europe to custodial clinic for adequate psychological or psychiatric treatment? Thank you.",
        "121": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have one question, which is addressed to both parties, to the government, as well as to the applicant. The parties before the court seem to be in agreement that no distinction should be made between, on one hand, the collection of taxes, and on the other hand, tax surcharges, as under domestic law, Belgian law, both are assessed in the single procedure, the same document, and they are inextricably linked for the purpose of the calculation of the limitation period. The parties, however, seem to draw different conclusions from the two limbs being closely tied. The chamber made it clear that Article 6 was not applicable to the tax proceedings, but applicable to the tax surcharges. Therefore, if one accepts the logic of the chamber, if there are any problems under Article 6, it will be solely because of the tax surcharges, not because of the tax assessment. Therefore, my following question, would it have been possible under Belgian law for Belgian authorities to pursue the assessment of the tax liability, but to refrain from imposing tax surcharges, or put in other words, could Belgian authorities have assessed that retrospective application of the new act in calculation of the statutes of limitation was justified for the purpose of tax assessment liability, but not for imposing the penalty, the tax surcharges? Thank you.",
        "122": "Merci beaucoup, monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question pour ma\u00eetre Wouters, mais le gouvernement est invit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper sa r\u00e9ponse aussi. Vous avez tous les deux adress\u00e9 cette question lors de vos plaidoiries et par \u00e9crit, mais je voudrais creuser un peu plus. Alors, selon la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clairante, la solution retenue par la Cour de cassation en 2002 ne constituait pas une nouvelle jurisprudence, mais la suite est la cons\u00e9quence normale de deux arr\u00eats de 1993. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clairante a estim\u00e9 dans ses observations \u00e9crites que la jurisprudence de 1993 \u00e9tait, et je cite, \u00ab d\u00e9pourvu de toute ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 et toute personne normalement prudente ne pouvait arriver \u00e0 la conclusion depuis lors qu'une simple mise en demeure sans disposition l\u00e9gale expresse pouvait valoir au titre d'acte d'interruption de la prescription \u00bb. Donc, ma question est assez simple. Pourquoi donc la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clairante n'a pas, en d\u00e9cembre 2000, lorsqu'elle a introduit son action en premi\u00e8re instance, soulev\u00e9 la question de la prescription? En effet, elle a attendu jusqu'\u00e0 avril 2004 pour ce faire, et pendant les observations orales, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clairante nous a expliqu\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 cause du besoin de certitude pour le r\u00e9clairant qu'elle ait intervenu en 2004. La raison pour laquelle je voudrais creuser un petit peu plus, c'est parce que cette question vise deux aspects qui pourraient \u00eatre importants en l'esp\u00e8ce, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'attente l\u00e9gitime de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clairante, mais aussi l'existence ou non d'un effet aubaine. Merci beaucoup.",
        "123": "Merci, monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question, ou plut\u00f4t une invitation \u00e0 revenir sur certains aspects d\u00e9j\u00e0 trait\u00e9s et peut-\u00eatre donner des pr\u00e9cisions. Premier aspect, l'existence et les caract\u00e9ristiques d'une jurisprudence au sujet de l'interruption de la prescription par un commandement de payer qu'on pourrait appeler pur. Si je ne me trompe pas, alors, le gouvernement se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 sept ou peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame huit d\u00e9cisions de premi\u00e8re instance d'appel dans le sens de l'interruption, tandis que la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation fournit 5 exemples dans le sens de la non-interruption, dont trois, si je ne me trompe pas, ont conduit au jugement de la Cour de cassation dont on parle ici. Les autres jugements, et je crois que ma\u00eetre Jafferali l'a not\u00e9, me semblent \u00eatre post\u00e9rieurs au jugement de la Cour de cassation. Alors, sur ce sujet-l\u00e0, il me semblerait important que chaque parti prenne position sur les exemples jurispondenciels fournis par l'autre parti. On a d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu ma\u00eetre Wouters, qui a dit que, selon lui, l'autre jurisprudence \u00e9tait minoritaire, tandis que ma\u00eetre Jafferali a parl\u00e9 d'une jurisprudence divis\u00e9e. Et l\u00e0, j'ai aussi l'obligation... Ah, je me trompe. J'ai aussi l'obligation de noter que les deux parties se sont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es, il me semble, exclusivement \u00e0 la jurisprudence publi\u00e9e. Je sais \u00e7a, s'il existe de la jurisprudence non publi\u00e9e. L'autre aspect, les nombres des affaires pendantes \u00e0 notre sujet et les sommes d'argent en jeu. Sur ce point, alors, les gouvernements se r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e0 la somme de 1,2 milliard d'euros qui est mentionn\u00e9e au fin de la d\u00e9cision optime et finist\u00e8re. Et, encore une fois, si je ne me trompe pas, cette somme renvoie au montant total affect\u00e9 par les lois-programmes de 2003 et 2004. Alors, je crois que la Cour, au fin de notre affaire, est int\u00e9ress\u00e9e surtout sur les montants attach\u00e9s par la loi-programme de 2004, exclusivement. Et les nombres des affaires pendantes, il me semble, n'est pas mentionn\u00e9s dans notre dossier. Alors, \u00e7a pourrait \u00eatre un sujet pour quelques pr\u00e9cisions. Merci.",
        "124": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would also like to thank the parties for their submissions. My first question is directed to the applicants' representatives and concerns the relationship between the alleged crimes and the events of June 2010. First of all, with respect to the misappropriation charges brought against the first applicant, is there any factual evidence in support of the allegation that they are based on ethnic bias? I would think that everyone accused of this kind of crime would claim insufficient evidence, but does this prove that the charges are ethnically motivated? With respect to the second applicant, I would like to hear more about the complaint that the murder and other charges were, in fact, fabricated. Is it enough nowadays to claim that the charges related to the inter-ethnic clashes of 2010 in order to find a real risk of ill treatment? And I would like to emphasize that we are taking a current perspective, excellent perspective here. Now, assuming that the charges were indeed ethnically motivated, one might ask, why then did the applicants apply for a refugee status, one of the applicants, only several years after coming to Russia? Moreover, I would like to know from both parties whether and why ethnic Uzbeks are at a heightened risk of ill treatment in detention in Kyrgyzstan nowadays compared to in the years after the clashes of 2010. I understood the applicant's representative to making this kind of claim, but I would like to have a little bit more of a clarification because so far what we've heard are allegations about the commission of torture, and this is somewhat related to the ethnic Uzbeks, but I haven't heard anything supporting this kind of allegation brought forward by the applicants. And then, in this respect, the question is also asked, who has to prove this kind of aspect? Turning now to the government representative, I would like to ask as follows. Did the domestic courts sufficiently evaluate the individual risks in light of the court's jurisprudence at the relevant time, including with respect to the assurances? Thank you very much.",
        "125": "The court asked already within the framework of the general questions to the parties in preparation of today's hearing whether the assurances provided by the Kyrgyz authorities in respect of the applicants had legal effects, were binding and reliable, and met with all the other requirements set out in the court's case law. Replying to the above concerning the binding character, the government in their observations before the grand chamber, I think this is in paragraph 68, qualified the assurances as being a sort of statement of confirmation of the obligations undertaken by Kyrgyzstan under the Minsk Convention of 1993. Also other instruments are mentioned, but they are not specifically indicated. The applicants, on the contrary, in general denied such binding effect. My question is, can the parties, and in particular the government, clarify in which way this Minsk Convention or any other international instrument is relevant in order for the court to assess the binding effect, and especially under which specific provision? Is this provision also relied upon explicitly or implicitly in the documents we have? Thank you.",
        "126": "Thank you, President. I would also like to ask the government to clarify certain issues related to the assurances. In particular, to what extent the assurance mechanism has changed over the past years so that the court could come to a different assessment than in Khamarokulov versus Russia judgment of 2015? More specifically, and also to amend the question put by Judge Sabato, what is the legal basis for monitoring mechanism by the diplomatic staff? We just heard from the applicants that there is no solid legal basis apart from the instructions referred to. Also, are visits scheduled for the early phase of detention, meaning after the transfer? And finally, what about the restrictions that according to the applicants made the mechanism fragile? Why is there is a need for prior authorization for the visits? And we heard this morning from the applicants that there is no guarantee that such a request will be granted. And why should Kyrgyz authorities be allowed to be physically present during the visits, even though they are prevented from listening to what is being said, and you have just confirmed that those visits should be private? Thank you very much.",
        "127": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to follow up on the question put to my distinguished colleague, Ms. Zeibert, on concerning the vulnerability of ethnic Uzbeks in Kyrgyzstan. So my question is addressed more to the applicants, but of course the government could also answer to this question. So could you give please more details concerning the practical, particular vulnerability of ethnic Uzbeks? Information, more detailed information on to what extent they are persecuted and more particularly, they are subjected to ill treatment because of their ethnic origin. And whether this real risk of being subjected to ill treatment is related to their ethnic origin or it's more related to the 2010 events. Thank you.",
        "128": "Thank you very much. I would like to pose a factual question which either party might address concerning the situation of the second applicant. We learned from the applicant's submissions that both charges and extradition requests against other people have been made in connection with the same events of which the second applicant has been charged with. I wonder if we have any information regarding what has happened to these other persons who have been charged with and in respect of whom extradition requests have been made. Do we have any information what has happened in those cases? Thank you.",
        "129": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. D'abord, j'ai une question qui s'adresse principalement aux r\u00e9currents. Dispose-vous d'informations concernant la situation actuelle des filles et petits-enfants des r\u00e9currents, s'agissant notamment de leur localisation exacte et leur \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9? Ensuite, j'ai 3 questions \u00e0 poser au gouvernement. Premi\u00e8rement, en ce qui concerne la juridiction. Les r\u00e9currents soutiennent que l'article 3, paragraphe 2 du protocole num\u00e9ro 4, est applicable par d\u00e9finition ou par sa nature, m\u00eame si les victimes se trouvent en dehors du territoire de leur \u00e9tat national, et que l'exercice de tout droit en vertu de cette disposition est tout simplement inconcevable sans la reconnaissance d'une juridiction extraterritoriale. D'apr\u00e8s vos observations \u00e9crites, il semble que votre gouvernement est d'accord avec ce point de vue. Et c'est bien le cas. Deuxi\u00e8mement, dans ces observations \u00e9crites, votre gouvernement fait valoir que les filles de r\u00e9currents doivent \u00eatre poursuives en Syrie pour les crimes commis dans ces pays. Alors, par quel type de tribunal qu'en est-il de l'avancement de la cr\u00e9ation d'un tribunal p\u00e9nal international \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard? Et troisi\u00e8mement, votre gouvernement a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans ces observations \u00e9crites et oralement \u00e0 cette audience au protocole \"cazeneuve\", un accord entre la France et la Turquie. Quel est le m\u00e9canisme pr\u00e9cis introduit par cet accord? A l'heure actuelle, y a-t-il des personnes qui retournent en France depuis la Syrie via la Turquie gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cet accord? Enfin, j'ai une question sur le droit international humanitaire, \u00e0 laquelle j'aimerais que tous les deux partis r\u00e9pondent si possible. Dans ces observations \u00e9crites, le gouvernement a soulign\u00e9 que les filles et petits-enfants de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ants, lorsqu'ils se trouvaient dans le camp, \u00e9taient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l'article 3 commun aux 4 conventions de Gen\u00e8ve de 2049. Les autorit\u00e9s locales kurdes sont les responsables directs des conditions dans le camp. Cependant, je note que selon l'article 1 commun aux 4 conventions de Gen\u00e8ve, tous les Etats partis aux instruments en question, y compris les Etats des nationalit\u00e9s respectives comme la France, sont tenus de veiller \u00e0 ce que ces autorit\u00e9s respectent leurs obligations au titre de l'article 3 commun, en faisant tout ce qui est raisonnablement \u00e0 leur pouvoir pour mettre fin aux violations de droits internationaux humanitaires. Voil\u00e0 donc ma question est la suivante. Cette obligation de faire tout ce qui est raisonnablement \u00e0 leur pouvoir pour mettre fin aux violations de droits internationaux humanitaires, peut-elle avoir une influence sur l'examen de ces affaires? Merci pour votre patience, et je vous remercie d'avance pour vos r\u00e9ponses. Je vous le pr\u00e9cise.",
        "130": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question de fait qui s'adresse aux repr\u00e9sentants du gouvernement fran\u00e7ais. Il appara\u00eet des pi\u00e8ces du dossier, et cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 redit dans les plaidoiries, que les demandes des familles, des 2 familles requ\u00e9rantes, tenant au rapatriement des filles et des petits-enfants, des requ\u00e9rants ici, sont rest\u00e9es sans r\u00e9ponse. Et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 qu'il y avait des d\u00e9cisions implicites de refus. Je voulais savoir si le gouvernement \u00e9tait en mesure d'expliquer ce choix de ne pas r\u00e9pondre. Il ne s'agit pas ici de dire pourquoi il y a eu une non-suite donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande. C'est vraiment une question de formalisation, d'absence de formalisation de la position fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la suite de demandes pr\u00e9cises et r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es. Merci.",
        "131": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question adress\u00e9e au gouvernement, mais bien \u00e9videmment, les requ\u00e9rants peuvent, s'ils le veulent, y r\u00e9pondre \u00e9galement. Ma question concerne la l\u00e9gislation en vigueur en France. Comme vous le savez, les requ\u00e9rants se passent sur l'article 3, ainsi que l'article 3 du protocole n\u00b04, aguent et invitent la Cour \u00e0 conclure que la France a une obligation positive de prendre des mesures pour faciliter le rapprochement des requ\u00e9rants vers la France. Une telle obligation existe-t-elle ou d\u00e9coule-t-elle de la Convention? C'est \u00e0 nous d'\u00e9tranger. Ma question est au gouvernement. Existe-t-il dans la l\u00e9gislation en vigueur en France un droit d'\u00eatre assist\u00e9 par son \u00c9tat si on est un citoyen fran\u00e7ais et on se trouve \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger? Existe-t-il un droit dans la l\u00e9gislation en France pour le rapprochement ou l'assistance? Bien \u00e9videmment, je suis conscient qu'un tel droit n'est pas justiciable. Je fais r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au Conseil d'\u00c9tat qui a dit que le Conseil d'\u00c9tat n'a pas comp\u00e9tence parce que, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la s\u00e9paration du pouvoir et les actes de gouvernement, la Cour a conclu qu'elle n'avait pas une comp\u00e9tence. L'existence d'un droit et la question de justabilit\u00e9, ce sont deux choses distinctes. Et donc, la deuxi\u00e8me question qui est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e, dans l'affirmative, si un tel droit existe, comment un particulier peut le faire ex\u00e9cuter ou le faire respecter si les tribunales administratifs se d\u00e9clarent incomp\u00e9tents? Donc, est-ce qu'il y a, existe-t-il d'autres moyens ou d'autres recours effectifs? Merci.",
        "132": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question aux avocats de r\u00e9currents. Les avocats de r\u00e9currents ont mentionn\u00e9 des tentatives pour entrer en contact avec les familles qui se trouvent en Syrie. J'aimerais avoir plus de pr\u00e9cisions sur ce point. Je voudrais demander quelles d\u00e9marches exactes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprises, \u00e0 quelle date, pour essayer de contacter les familles en Syrie? Est-ce que les r\u00e9currents ont aussi entrepris d'autres d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s autonomes du nord-est syrien, en vue soit de faciliter le contact avec la famille qui se trouve l\u00e0-bas, ou en vue d'am\u00e9liorer leurs conditions de d\u00e9tention?

Merci.",
        "133": "Thank you very much. I have two questions for the government. The first is more of a clarification on the position. So it is my understanding that the French government has a position that the adults in the camps, including the daughters of the applicants in these cases, are not to be repatriated, that no effort is made to be repatriated. And that is not a question of a capacity to do so, but a policy. So if my understanding is correct on that point. And if so, whether that applies irrespective of the potential dangers to their life, the conditions of their detention, the duration of their detention, and the realistic likelihood of them getting a fair trial where they are now. The second question, and both of these questions leave aside for the moment the issue of jurisdiction, relates to your claim, as I understand it, you have ruled out any form of positive obligation in respect to repatriation, either under Article III of the Convention or Article III of the Fourth Protocol. Let's envisage a situation where a large number of French tourists, due to some transportation disaster, are stranded on a deserted island, which happens to be within the territory of another state, but for some complicated reasons, they would face certain death in the absence of intervention by the French authorities. And let's also assume that this situation is due in part also to their own recklessness. Would it be your submission, then, in such circumstances, there would be no duty, no form of positive obligation under the Convention to undertake any effort, any form of effort, to try and bring them back to the country? Or is it a question of some situations being more sympathetic than others? Thank you.",
        "134": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for the applicants and a question for the government, but both parties can answer both questions if they want. The first question is to the applicants. It's about the applicants' connection with Latvia. We heard from you that there are objective legal ties with Latvia. My question is more about the subjective ties. And I apologize if this is a personal question and if you think that it is not relevant, you can of course tell me. But I would like to know whether the applicants consider themselves Latvians. And we heard about the difficulties to obtain naturalization. But is it possible to say that there is a choice of not acquiring Latvian citizenship? And if so, why did then the applicants prefer not to acquire that Latvian citizenship? My second question is for the government. All the applicants in this case worked for some time outside Latvia, and that's the reason why they didn't get that supplement. But I would like to know whether the difference of treatment extinguishes with the passing away of the applicants, or whether there are further effects, for instance on their children, coming from that situation. Thank you.",
        "135": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions to both parties. First question, I'd like to ask about the naturalization in Latvia, whether there were any new trends in this area. And more specifically, are there any differences as regards naturalization between permanently resident non-citizens on one side and foreigners and status persons on the other side? And my second question to the government, but of course the applicants, representatives may also intervene and answer this question. Are there any differences, or do you see any differences in the factual situations of the applicants in the present case that would justify a differentiated approach of our court vis-a-vis their complaints? Thank you.",
        "136": "Thank you. I have two questions. The first question goes to the Ms. L\u012bce, representative of the government. From the outset, the case was made as concerning the supplements of the pensions, whereas we heard from the representative of the applicants that this concerns these periods of employment concerns the pension itself. So I would like to clarify and comment on the impact on the pension itself that the applicants receive. This is a question to the government representative, but of course also the applicant representatives may comment on it. And the second question goes to applicant representative, and in particular to what Ms. Niku\u013cceva was saying. I would like to clarify what is the basis for an argument that Latvia must assume responsibility for paying pensions for the periods of employment of permanent resident non-citizens outside the territory of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic. So it was mentioned, but I'm not sure I clearly understood it. Of course, representative of the government may comment on this question as well. Thank you.",
        "137": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I refer this question to both parties, and it's based on a document published on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia entitled, Basic Facts About Citizenship and Language Policy of Latvia and Some Sensitive History-Related Issues. And in it, there is a paragraph which reads as follows, and I quote, Non-citizens enjoy equal protection under the law, both in Latvia and while living or traveling abroad, and are the only group of persons, in addition to citizens, who are granted permanent residence in Latvia ex legae. Non-citizens have the same social guarantees as Latvian citizens, including, for example, with regard to pensions and unemployment benefits. As to political rights, the only significant difference between Latvian citizens and non-citizens is the right to vote and to work in the civil service or occupy posts directly related to national security. I would be interested in the observations of both parties in relation to that very broad statement on equal protection under the law in Latvia. Thank you very much.",
        "138": "Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the government agent for answering my first question. But I'm afraid my second question may have been wrongly interpreted or misunderstood. My second question was whether you see any differences in the factual situation of the current applicants, of the applicants in the present case, among them, if there are any differences in the factual situation of the applicants that would justify, in your view, a differentiated approach of our court vis-a-vis their complaints. Thank you.",
        "139": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. The case was referred to the Grand Chamber of the Court based on the applicant's request related to Article 9. I take, however, note that the agent of the Norwegian government, both in the written submissions and now during the hearing this morning, has entered into close to a full-fledged reassessment, also under Article 8, where the chamber unanimously found a violation. I have two closely interconnected questions to the agent of the Norwegian government related to the government's position on the interpretation and application of Article 8 taken in isolation, leaving out now the issues under Article 9. Of course, the representative of the applicant is free to address these questions, too, should she so wish. I read the Norwegian government's written submissions to the effect that it agrees with the Starnloeben principles, as did the Norwegian Supreme Court in its Grand Chamber follow rulings 27 March late and subsequent follow-up rulings from that court since then, in parallel with this court's follow-up judgments. The government's position appears to be confirmed by the oral pleadings this morning. My first question is this. Have I understood the Norwegian government position correctly, that the government agrees with the Starrloeben principles in their full range, and now forcefully ask the Grand Chamber of the court both to guard these principles and to apply them? Assuming that the agent will answer this first question in the affirmative, my second question is whether the Norwegian government also accept this court's reading of Starnloeben, as this reading transpires from the court's application of the Starn Loeben principles in subsequent chamber judgments, such as KO and VM versus Norway, November 2019, AS versus Norway, December 2019, Peterson and others versus Norway, 10 March 2020, and Herne Hult versus Norway, 10 March 2020. I need to expound some more on the context and substance of this second question. I remind you that these four Norwegian chamber judgments are all unanimous in finding a violation of Article 8. They were decided by alternating chamber formations. They all refer to and explicitly state that they apply the Starnloeben principles. And they are all final. After the Grand Chamber panel in September last rejected the Norwegian government's request for having the two of them, Peterson and others, and Herne Hult referred to the Grand Chamber. Apart from the fact that the chamber judgment in the current case is not final, Abdi Ibrahim blends apparently squarely and seamlessly into this group of cases. The same can be said about the most recent judgment against Norway on this issue, namely ML versus Norway, 22 December 2020. In addition, the Starnloeben principles have, of course, been referred to and applied by the court in a number of parallel judgments against other member states. I note here that the government's argument before the Grand Chamber panel in Peterson and others and in Herne Hult was that the chamber judgment in those two cases did not represent a correct application of Starnloeben. Moreover, the Norwegian government's arguments before the Grand Chamber panel in those cases were apparently quite similar to those submitted now before the Grand Chamber in this current case, notably arguments in substance related to a lack of deference to the assessment carried out by the domestic authorities. That is, too little subsidiarity, too little margin of appreciation, too much substantial review. And that the court laid too little emphasis on the best interest of the child, but rather gave priority to the biological parents. I also note that the Norwegian government did not ask for the current case, Abdi Ibrahim, to be referred to the Grand Chamber. Nonetheless, the old argument that the Norwegian chamber judgments following up Starn Loeben are not really in compliance with Starn Loeben, but represent rather an extension, is apparently still alive. The alleged errors in the chamber are in substance not case specific. The core critique is systemic. Going to the court's role and the level and character of the European control mechanism under the convention. Indeed, we recognize the gist of these arguments in the submissions made before the Grand Chamber in the current case by the intervening Danish government in referral also to the Copenhagen Declaration. So finally, here is the real substance of my second question. Taking into account the context that I have now just briefly described, and that in cases like this one, where the family ties are cut completely and permanently over, the threshold under Article 8 is indeed very high. And the court applies, according to Starn Loeben, stricter scrutiny, which will inevitably also narrow the margin of appreciation. Would it at all be possible for the court to not finding a violation of Article 8 in this case, as it now stands, without also in the same vein calling into question not only the bulk of chamber judgments handed down subsequently to Starn Loeben, but also Starn Loeben itself? Is the government not in reality, by the character of its arguments, in fact inviting the Grand Chamber of the court to reopen Starn Loeben as precedence and take one or more steps back? And even if this is not the intention of the government, would there not be a real risk that a Grand Chamber judgment not finding a violation of Article 8, based on the arguments forwarded by the government, would be perceived as watering down the Starn Loeben principles? I apologize for having used so much valuable time. And I thank you for your patience, Mr. President. And I thank the agent for the Norwegian government in advance for his replies to my inquiries.",
        "140": "Thank you, Mr. President. In paragraph 119 of their submissions, the Norwegian government highlight the fact that Article 2 of Protocol Number 1 did not feature in the application to the court or in the referral request. Presumably because of the former, the chamber didn't address this article. So could the parties explain why Article 2 of Protocol 1 can now be considered to fall within the scope of the case before the Grand Chamber? And is the government in paragraph 119 pointing to a possible exhaustion problem in relation to this article? Thank you very much.",
        "141": "Thank you very much. I actually have two questions. One is primarily to the government. We have heard both parties arguing extensively on the one hand that the authorities did not do enough to find a family with the same or a similar ethnic, religious or cultural background, or the other party said the authorities did enough. Assuming that indeed it was not possible to find such a family, were there nevertheless other restrictions relating to the choice of a foster family among families that do not have the same characteristics as the applicant? So it's not only, my question is, is there not only a question of trying to find the appropriate family, but also avoiding other families? And how does that work in practice? And the second question is primarily directed to the applicant. I heard when the applicant was arguing about Article 9 that at a given moment, but she did not seem, the lawyer did not seem to develop that, she spoke of the positive obligations under Article 9. Could the applicant explain what the complaint is about? Is it about an interference by the state in freedom of religion or about a failure to fulfill a positive obligation under Article 9? Thank you.",
        "142": "Merci beaucoup, monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai deux questions, une destin\u00e9e \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentante de la requ\u00e9rante et la deuxi\u00e8me destin\u00e9e \u00e0 l'agent du gouvernement. Commen\u00e7ons donc par la question destin\u00e9e \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentante de la requ\u00e9rante. Si j'ai bien compris, aujourd'hui, pendant votre pl\u00e9thorie, vous avez demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9ouverture de la proc\u00e9dure interne en base de l'article 46, si j'ai bien compris. J'aimerais bien que vous le confirmiez. Si tel est le cas, pour autant que j'ai bien compris votre position devant la Chambre, vous n'avez pas demand\u00e9 telle possibilit\u00e9. Est-ce que vous pouvez expliquer \u00e0 quoi est d\u00fb ce changement de position et pourquoi introduisez-vous, si tel est le cas, devant la Grande Chambre cette nouvelle pr\u00e9tention? Ma deuxi\u00e8me question se dirige particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'agent du gouvernement. Le gouvernement que vous repr\u00e9sentez n'a pas effectu\u00e9 aucune demande de renvoi du jugement de la Chambre. Donc, normalement, s'il n'y a pas de p\u00e9tition de renvoi, cela devrait normalement nous laisser entendre que le gouvernement \u00e9tait d'accord avec le jugement de la Chambre. Or, dans votre m\u00e9moire, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant la Grande Chambre le 25 novembre 2020, au niveau de vos conclusions, notamment au niveau du paragraphe 166, vous demandez \u00e0 ce que la Chambre conclue \u00e0 la non-violation en solitaire de l'article 8. Pouvez-vous, s'il vous pla\u00eet, nous expliquer la raison de cette apparente contradiction? Je vous remercie.",
        "143": "Merci beaucoup monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma premi\u00e8re question est plut\u00f4t factuelle, elle est un peu li\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question du juge Lemmens. Il y a une contradiction entre ce que la r\u00e9currente et le gouvernement disent par rapport aux essais que le gouvernement, les autorit\u00e9s norv\u00e9giennes ont fait de trouver une famille d'accueil pour le fils de r\u00e9currente, une famille qui soit d'origine somalienne ou de croyance musulmane. Donc je voudrais que les deux parties r\u00e9p\u00e8tent quels sont vraiment ces essais, comment sont pass\u00e9s et j'ai une question subs\u00e9quente, est-ce que, qui est pos\u00e9e au gouvernement, est-ce que le gouvernement et les autorit\u00e9s norv\u00e9giennes ont pens\u00e9 de trouver aussi une famille s\u00e9culi\u00e8re vu la position de la r\u00e9currente mais aussi les experts dans la croyance musulmane qui expliquent le fait que \u00eatre n\u00e9 musulman signifie compl\u00e8tement diff\u00e9remment autre chose par rapport \u00e0 des autres croyances. \u00c7a c'est ma premi\u00e8re question. Ma deuxi\u00e8me question est relative \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les deux parties voient le rapport entre l'article 9 de la convention et l'article 2 du protocole 1 parce qu'il me semble que la r\u00e9currente avait fait des propos par rapport \u00e0 la cour de trouver une violation de l'article 9 en relation avec cet article 2 tandis que le gouvernement nous a dit que l'article 9 sans doute il est plus large. Donc quelle sera la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence du gouvernement et de la r\u00e9currente par rapport au rapport entre ces deux articles? Merci beaucoup.",
        "144": "Thank you, President. My question echoes questions put by judges Lemmens and Motoc on Article 9, but it goes to the applicant. In your memorial, you relied heavily on the case of Tenenbaum versus Sweden, that concerned decision by the Swedish authorities to place their daughters in a Protestant foster family rather than a Jewish one, although they were Jewish, in which the commission stressed on the principles that the authorities were obliged to take into consideration the applicants' wish to have their children be placed in Jewish foster home. And you rightly say that this applies in the present case as well. However, in the Tenenbaum, the commission declared this complaint inadmissible because, I quote, the social authorities explored the possibilities of placing the children in a Jewish foster home, but their endeavors failed because of the other considerations, such as the difficulty to find, without any unnecessary waste of time, relevant home not far from the parents. In the present case, authorities explored three options of placing the applicant's son to a Muslim family not far from the applicant's home. They all failed before placing him in a Christian foster home. So my question is, where do you see the differences between these two situations that would justify, in your view, departure from the findings in the Tenenbaum case? Thank you.",
        "145": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have questions to both parties. One question about the situation that has nothing to do with the Section 6 of the Act of 2017. The second question is specifically about the situation created by Section 6 of that Act. The first situations before and after the amending Act. And I would like to know more about the possibilities for the premature termination of the mandate of a member of the National Council of the Judiciary. What are the grounds for a premature termination? There are a number of grounds that are listed in the Act. I know them. But I'm wondering whether there are possibilities for other, whether there are other grounds for termination relating, for instance, to the fact that the member is not actively participating or that he has been convicted for a crime or something else. Are there possibilities for a premature termination based on an explicit decision to be taken? And if so, who would take such a decision? And would there be a possibility for a member of the NCJ to contest such a decision before it has been taken and or after it has been taken? So I would like to know how that was before the Section 6 Act, before the Act of 2017, and also how it is now. Maybe it's the same situation. Secondly, Section 6 of the Act of 2017 terminates Mr. Grz\u0119da's term of office and of his colleagues' Ekslege. The applicant twice stated and very clearly here before us that there was no possibility to challenge this provision before the Constitutional Court. And I would like to ask the government whether the government fully agrees with that statement. And I have another question relating to this Section 6 of the Act of 2017. We have heard a lot about the applicability of Article 6, paragraph 1. We have heard that for the applicant, there was a dispute about the unconstitutionality of the Act. The applicant states that the Act violated the Article 6 and 187 of the Constitution. He also states that there was a civil right, a right to serve a mandate for four years. All that I understand, and my question is not about that. But there is also a complaint about Article 13. And here I would like to know what is the alleged violation of the applicant's rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention. In other words, from the point of view of Article 13, we are not dealing with civil rights anymore. What are the rights and freedoms that the applicant would have invoked? And how would these rights and freedoms exactly have been violated by the Act? Thank you.",
        "146": "Thank you. I have one question for the government, but of course the other party can also comment. In your observations and presentation, you state that the exclusion of the members of the NCJ from the right of access to a court is systematically corroborated on the ground of the act, the acting question. And you provide examples regarding the permanent members of the Council's Bureau. So I would ask if you could elaborate on this argument whether the exclusion is systematically corroborated, but particularly regarding for the judges who are holding the position only as members of the Council, like the applicants. Thank you.",
        "147": "Thank you, Mr. President. The case before the court, of course, concerns termination of office of the NCJ member. And my distinguished colleagues have already asked questions concerning that. But indirectly, there is another point which the parties have argued before us today, which is the construction of Article 187 of the Polish Constitution of 1997 in the part in which it does not provide, and I'm quoting, I think, the agent of the government, for any particular way of the judge members to be elected. And therefore, this has been argued, this was left under paragraph four of the same article to a statute. And so the statute was changed, and so on and so forth. Now, my question concerns the intention of the founders of this Polish Constitution on 1997. We have not had an occasion of having any reference to, for example, preparatory works. We have read the constitutional court judgments, and there have been arguments by the parties concerning that, some references to doctrine. But in my opinion, it would be very important for the court to know. And so my question is addressed to both parties. What can be objectively found in the preparatory works to the Constitution? There is one mention in the documents before us that there was an inspiration on the constitutions of Italy, France, and Spain. And objectively, seeing this article, in my opinion, and I wish to be corrected if I'm wrong, is very close to the article, if I'm not wrong, 122 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, which also doesn't tell the body competent to choose those judges. And there's been a sort of little, if I'm not wrong, a little constitutional crisis in Spain when the method was changed. If I'm not wrong, at this time judges choose a list, and it is submitted to Parliament in that country. So my interest is in preparatory works to your Constitution. Thank you.",
        "148": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have similar questions to both parties, but I will read them separately. A question to the applicant. In your Article 6 complaint, you assert that there had been no national legal provision expressly excluding access to a court for a claim based on the alleged unlawfulness of determination of your mandate as a member of the Council of Judiciary. But at the same time, you allege that there has been a violation of Article 13, so no effective remedy. So how could you reconcile these two assertions? Did you have the right, simply, without much, did you have the right under Polish law to challenge that determination or not? And a very similar but reversed question to the government. Regarding applicant's Article 6 complaint, the government maintains that the Polish law excluded access to court for claims relating to the membership in the National Council of the Judiciary. But you also argue that the remedy had been available for the purposes of Article 13. So how to reconcile these two assertions? Was there a remedy or not? And now, after listening to the discussions, I have one more question. I understand from the submissions of oral, especially oral submissions of the government, that the central or the most crucial significance is attributed to the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal of 2017. Because it was this judgment which had to be implemented by the follow-up act, statutory amendment, which then had the effect of termination of mandate. So that judgment of the 20th of June of 2017. And the court has been presented with a translation of that judgment. And I would like to cite one paragraph of that judgment, one phrase, actually, of that judgment. But before citing that and asking for a comment on that, I would say that perhaps we all know that there are certain standards, universally accepted, internationally accepted standards, long-standing standards of constitutional interpretation. Such methods are used as method of legislative intent, teleological method, purportive interpretation, linguistic method, systemic methods, historical methods, and so on. So now I will cite that judgment. The constitutional court, in the current composition, does not agree with the constitutional court's position adopted in the judgment of 18th of July 2007, number 25K2507, that the Constitution specifies that judicial members of the NCJ shall be elected by judges. Especially the words, court in the current composition does not agree. Could you please comment? First of all, I ask that to the representative of the government comment on which of the universally accepted standards of constitutional interpretation that thesis relies upon. And I also call for the applicant, the representative of the applicant, to comment on that issue if they wish so. Thank you very much.",
        "149": "Thank you. I have two questions for the applicant. The first relates to your claim that we're dealing with a civil right in this case. And in making that claim, you seem to rely extensively on the emotional or moral impact of the early termination on the applicant, as there seem to be no financial implications in the ordinary labor law sense of the term. My question is, what is the basis in our case law for your suggestion that the emotional impact is enough to make this a civil right? I suppose a minister fired by the prime minister of parliament would also be quite disappointed, and I assume that's understandable. But I suppose you would not suggest that that would give the minister's civil right in the Article VI sense of the term. My second question relates to the second part of the Eskalinan test, if we get to that point, where, as I understand, you've essentially invited the court to set aside a legislative act of the national legislature because it goes contrary to the rule of law and the systems of checks and balances. But now those are quite broad concepts. Is there a specific rule of law with a small \"r\" that is universally, or at least in a prevailing way, accepted and applied in the Council of Europe legal space that you can identify that has been violated in the current case? Thank you.",
        "150": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une batterie de questions \u00e0 l'attention du requ\u00e9rant, des repr\u00e9sentants du requ\u00e9rant. Je leur prie d'\u00eatre le plus pr\u00e9cis possible. M\u00eame si ces questions sont dirig\u00e9es donc au requ\u00e9rant, bien entendu, la r\u00e9action du gouvernement serait la bienvenue s'il contesterait les donn\u00e9es fournies par le requ\u00e9rant. 3 questions. La 1re est la suivante. Quel \u00e9tait le montant exact de la derni\u00e8re pension de veuvage per\u00e7ue par le requ\u00e9rant? 2e question. Quelles \u00e9taient les sources de revenus du requ\u00e9rant entre ces 57 ans et l'\u00e2ge de sa retraite? Et derni\u00e8re, au moment de l'annulation de sa pension, quelle \u00e9tait la situation de ses enfants? Est-ce que le requ\u00e9rant a r\u00e9ellement subvenu \u00e0 leur n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 compte tenu de la pension d'orphelins et d'autres aides publiques qu'elle percevait selon le gouvernement? Je vous remercie.",
        "151": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question pour le gouvernement sur le fonds de l'article 14, li\u00e9 de l'article 8. Si la Cour trouverait la requ\u00eate r\u00e9servable? Je r\u00e9f\u00e8re au paragraphe 10 de la Chambre, qui dit que le tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral jugea que la distinction op\u00e9r\u00e9e par les articles 23 et 24 de la LAVS \u00e9tait effectivement contraire aux principes d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre l'homme et la femme consacr\u00e9 par l'article 8 ali\u00e9natoire de la Constitution. Donc, ma question, quel est, selon le gouvernement, l'impact de cette conclusion par le tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral quant \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation de notre Cour de l'article 14 li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 8? Merci beaucoup.",
        "152": "Thank you, Mr. President. Well, the parties so far have focused in their pleadings on the consequences of the withdrawal of the pension on the applicant's family when their children turned 18 years old. What hasn't been addressed so far is, however, the impact of the regulatory regime on the applicant's family when he took the decision to quit his job and take care of his children. Now, it appears that he had to take a higher risk than widows when they seek to return to the labor market. In other words, if a widower decides to exercise his right to family life by taking care of his minor children, he finds himself in a different situation than widows who count on the continued payment of their widow pension. And my question is as follows. What were the effects of the legal framework on the applicant's organization of his family life when he left his prior employment? And could this be a potential ground for rendering Article 8 applicable in the case for the purpose of Article 814? Thank you.",
        "153": "Thank you very much. Mr. President, I have three sets of questions which relate to the pension, the legitimate aim relied on, and also a question relating to statistics, which follows up on the question just made by Judge Seibert-Fohr. And I address them to both parties, but principally to the government. As regards the pension system, in your written observations, you've principally emphasized sections 23 and 24. But I think, like Judge Pere Pastor Vilanova, we need to know more about the orphan's pension. And I have a more general question relating to the Social Security benefits paid. Social Security systems are usually integrated, so can you explain which, if any, supplementary benefits paid to the applicant or his children were linked or indexed to the fact that he was paid a widower's pension? For example, could the widow or widower's pension be supplemented if the income of the surviving parent or child is modest? My next question relates to the legitimate aim relied on. According to the well-established case law of this court, references to traditions, general assumptions, and prevailing social attitudes constitute insufficient justification for differential treatment. I therefore turn to the chamber judgment and what the government relied on before the chamber, which was, and I quote, paragraph 71 of the chamber judgment, the legitimate aim relied on is the assumption that a husband provides for the financial maintenance of his wife, particularly where she has children. So I would ask the government to address the legitimate aim they are now relying on in the light of the well-established case law I've just referred to. My final point relates to statistics. And as I said, it links in with the question just asked by Judge Seibert-Fohr. The government has provided us with statistics in their written observations relating to the percentage of men and women in full-time employment and the percentage of women in employment working part-time. However, for the purpose of assessing the withdrawal of the pension when the children reached the age of majority, I'm trying to understand why we don't have statistics for the employment rate of men and women who seek to re-enter the labor market after a substantial number of years, in this case 17 years, after being absent and within less than 10 years from retirement age. The government referred us to a 2012 study which suggests that more widowers than widows exercise their choice to remain economically active. But my question is, does this not point to the likelihood that the re-entry of men who have chosen to stay at home would be particularly difficult in the context of the Swiss labor market? Thank you.",
        "154": "Merci Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai trois questions \u00e0 poser. La premi\u00e8re, j'aimerais savoir jusqu'\u00e0 quel \u00e2ge les filles du requ\u00e9rant \u00e9taient en formation et dor\u00e9navant qu'il a d\u00fb subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins. Jusqu'\u00e0 quel \u00e2ge elles \u00e9taient en formation. Deuxi\u00e8me question, au gouvernement, on a des statistiques des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires d'une rente de veuve 1593 en 2019 tandis qu'il y avait une rente de veuve 38378 dans le m\u00eame temps. Nous savons qu'il y a deux cas de figure de rente de veuve. Une similaire \u00e0 cette rente de veuve avec des enfants mineurs et l'autre, les veuves qui ont au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du mari 45 ans ou plus et qu'elle s'\u00e9tait mari\u00e9e pendant cinq ans. Est-ce que le gouvernement a des statistiques pour les rentes de veuve similaires aux rentes de veuve? Les rentes de veuve avec des enfants mineurs n'est pas l'autre cas de figure de rente de veuve, celle de 45 ans. C'est la premi\u00e8re question pour le gouvernement et la deuxi\u00e8me dont la pl\u00e9thorie, le gouvernement a mentionn\u00e9 une allocation de formation de 250 francs que chacune des filles aurait pu toucher. Est-ce qu'il s'agit avec cette allocation de formation de l'allocation familiale dans le sens de la loi ou est-ce qu'il s'agit d'autre chose? Allocation familiale dans le sens de la loi suisse sont pas allou\u00e9es aux filles mais aux parents. Ici, aux p\u00e8res qui auraient pu les utiliser ou auraient d\u00fb les utiliser pour subvenir aux besoins des enfants. Est-ce qu'il s'agit de \u00e7a? Est-ce qu'il s'agit d'une allocation pour le p\u00e8re pour qu'il peut subvenir aux besoins des enfants? All\u00e9ger sa t\u00e2che de subvenir aux besoins des enfants pendant la dur\u00e9e de la dur\u00e9e de la formation.",
        "155": "Thank you, Mr. President. Thanks to the representative of the parties for their clear interventions. I have one question to the government and one question to the applicants. As regards my question to the government, as you have pointed out, the revocation of the license was at the end of an uninterrupted series of sanctions. You submitted that the council had no choice than to apply the harshest sanction. I note that the most severe sanction before revocation that was imposed on NIT was the suspension of the license of five days. My question is, did the council have discretionary power to opt for imposing a sanction with a more deterrent effect, such as, for instance, suspension of the license for one month, two months, or three months, thus being less intrusive than the revocation? And if so, why did it not make use of that power? My question to the applicants is the following. Before the domestic courts, NIT argued that the decision to revoke its license was politically driven. The domestic courts rejected that allegation as being unsubstantiated. Before this court, NIT repeats that allegation. In its written submissions, NIT states that, I quote, the political class by all means wanted to find a judicial solution to put an end to the channel's existence. And the withdrawal of the license was motivated by political revenge of the government. This is a severe allegation. And such an allegation could be accepted, but only when it's supported by at least strong and concrete indications. My question to you is, could you provide the court with concrete facts that support your allegation that the revocation decision taken by the council in 2012 was politically driven? Thank you.",
        "156": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My questions are for both parties. The monitoring exercise which led to the revocation decision in this case was commenced on the 29th of March, 2012. The report was communicated to the applicant only two days later, on the 2nd of April. It was discussed by the council with the applicant present on the 5th of April, and the decision was adopted on that same day. And it came into force on the 6th of April. So my question is, is such a rapid administrative procedure normal and in conformity with domestic law? And I ask this because I note that the Supreme Court referred to a normal administrative procedure taking 15 working days. My second question relates to monitoring exercises and their consequences generally. I understand that 13 monitoring exercises took place in the relevant period between 2009 and 2012. This question is particularly directed at the government, but the applicant can, of course, respond. Could the government indicate if sanctions were imposed on other broadcasters during this period? They said in their oral submissions that other broadcasters were monitored. But what I would like to know is where those broadcasters sanctioned. If so, how often and for what? In the file, I could only find one concrete example. That was the public warning given to national television in the decision of the 5th of April, 2012. Thank you very much.",
        "157": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My question is for the government, and it relates to the enforcement of the withdrawal decision. And it is a matter of domestic law. My first element would be attached to Article 3810 of the Ordovisual Code. And at the material time, this provision had the following wording, a decision by the Ordovisual Coordinating Council applying a sanction which is not contested within the allocated time limit shall constitute a writ of enforcement. And my question to the government relating to this provision would be if the government could please specify its understanding of that provision at the material time. The second element of my question connected to this relates then to the subsequent change of this provision. End of May 2012, this provision was abolished, and then we had a new provision in 38.8 with the following wording, the decision of the Ordovisual Coordinating Council regarding the application of any sanction will be motivated becoming enforceable from the date of adoption and notification to the broadcasters and distributors of targeted services by registered letter with subsequent publication. My question related to this provision would be what was the motivation behind the adjustment of the text, the changement of the text from the previous article 38.10 to the new 38.8 in May 2012? And the third element of the question relates to the subsequent development. The Constitutional Court, as I understand it, found that the new provision, article 38.8, was in violation of the Constitution, and in particular as to the Constitution's provisions on free speech. And my third element, the question here would be what was the core reasoning in the Constitutional Court's judgments as to this finding? Thank you.",
        "158": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for the government, but of course the applicant is very welcome to address them as well. My first question relates to the formula for the appointment of the audiovisual council. And I refer here to annex 16 of the government's submissions, which include the Council of Europe analysis and comments on a former draft, so pre-final draft of the audiovisual code, and specifically page 29 of this Council of Europe comments related to then-draft Article 42 of the bill. And the third comment by the Council of Europe is that the appointment by a 2 3rd majority of parliament, and I quote here, is to be welcome. It is, however, my understanding that in the final version of the draft, a number of changes were made in line with the Council of Europe recommendations that the 2 3rd majority, which the Council of Europe had welcomed, has been removed altogether from the draft. And I was wondering if you could elucidate a little bit in terms of the legislative history, why was that decision made? And in relation to that, in your submission here today orally, you argued that the council had full independence in law and in fact. And if you could comment on the European Commission's country progress report for 2012, so it's the relevant period, it's a report done annually as part of the European Neighborhood Partnership process of Moldova dated 20 March 2013. There is a single recommendation there on the media scene in the country, and I quote, ensure the full and effective independence of the audiovisual coordinating council. So if you could comment on that, please. And my second question is a little bit of a follow up to Judge B\u00e5rdsen third question on the constitutional court ruling of 6 December 2012. And what I would like to know specifically is what do you think the implications of that ruling, again, that it was unconstitutional for two, in particular, two sanctions imposed by the council, temporary suspension of license and final de-licensing, to be immediately enforceable. That is my understanding of the constitutional court decision. What, in your view, are the implications of the decision for the current case? And I don't mean in terms of national administrative law. I mean in terms of national constitutional law and Article 10 of the convention. Thank you.",
        "159": "Thank you very much. I'm interested in which way the monitoring exercises are organized. Are they organized on the regular basis, few times a year, once a year, for how long? Or they are organized ad hoc? It's just a coincidence that this last monitoring exercise that was the basis for the decision was actually at the time when the demonstrations were organized or were about to be organized. So if you please can answer that. Then what are the parameters that were taken into consideration then when pluralism was measured? Was it just content-based parameter? Or other parameters were taken into consideration because we know there are a number of them, if you could clarify that. And then what caught my eye today during the presentations was the claim that the members of the commission were subjectively and objectively independent. And when I was reading the minutes, what caught my eye was, and I will read the sentence of one of the participants. Moreover, we remember the shows that were made, even regarding me personally, I did not react. It was, I consider, abnormal. So this is something what was reported by the station about him. But as history shows, harmful phenomena leave a mark on what is happening. So if you could comment on conflicts of interest and the possibility of a person to sit in this commission deciding on this case. Thank you.",
        "160": "Thank you very much. I have a follow-up question to what my colleague O'Leary asked about the time taken by the council to come to its decision. There was a notification of the report to the applicant on the 2nd of April, I think. And on the 5th of April, there was the meeting and the decision. We can also see that during the domestic proceedings, the applicant company complained about the fact that it did not have enough time to prepare its defense for that meeting. Could both parties say something about this, whether it is normal not only to have such a short time for the preparation, but in particular, such a short time for the hearing to be set once the monitoring report is being sent to the broadcasting company concerned? And could the broadcasting company have asked for an adjournment of that meeting? And would it have any chance of being granted? Thank you.",
        "161": "Do we know in this concrete case who ordered the monitoring and on which basis with which explanation this five days monitoring that was taking place before we got this decision that we are having in front of us?",
        "162": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai 2 questions \u00e0 formuler aux repr\u00e9sentants du gouvernement. Bien entendu, le requ\u00e9rant est libre d'y r\u00e9pondre si tel est son choix. Selon l'expos\u00e9 des motifs de la loi relative \u00e0 l'administration fiscale de 2003, la publication des donn\u00e9es personnelles des contribuables d\u00e9faillants doit encourager un comportement respectueux de la loi, mais aussi de faire conna\u00eetre au tiers la solvabilit\u00e9 des contribuables. Mes questions sont alors les suivantes. Quand une personne physique est d\u00e9bitrice de l'Etat au titre de sa responsabilit\u00e9 civile ou p\u00e9nale, est-ce que son identit\u00e9 et domicile sont aussi d\u00e9voil\u00e9s publiquement? Si tel n'est pas le cas, pouvez-vous justifier cette \u00e9ventuelle diff\u00e9rence de traitement en faveur du fisc? Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, est-ce que les personnes condamn\u00e9es p\u00e9nalement pour fraude fiscale sont-elles l'objet d'une forme de publicit\u00e9 sur un portail d'Internet libre d'acc\u00e8s? Je vous remercie.",
        "163": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have two questions. One is addressed to the government and the other one to the applicant. My question to the government concerns the search interface that was introduced as of the 1st of January 2020 based on the 2017 amendment of the Tax Administration Act. I'm perfectly aware that the government is objecting to the admissibility, arguing that the applicants failed to exhaust domestic remedies. Leave that aside for a second. My question is, in the view of the government, is this search interface more or less intrusive, a more serious or less serious interference with the applicant's rights compared to the Article 55, Paragraph 5 enlist, meaning that this information is not accessible, it doesn't give us the access to the full list, it requires searching, but at the same time, it also includes time-barred tax debts. My question to the applicant concerns the reputation. The applicant is, before the Grand Chamber, heavily relying upon the protection of reputation, arguing that the publication of the tax debt's list touches upon the applicant's reputation or honor. My question concerns what is the legal basis for that argument. Is there any case law supporting that view? And let me explain very briefly why I'm asking that question. We have extensive case law concerning defamation proceedings. If someone disseminates subjective assessments or unproven facts or accusations concerning an individual's moral, ethical, or legal behavior, it may touch upon honor and reputation. On the other hand, dissemination of objective facts about an individual which are factually correct but of a private nature may touch upon private life. So my question is why, in the view of the applicant, does dissemination of objective facts, tax debts, about the applicant which is factually correct, how can it, and on what legal basis, touch upon honor and reputation? Thank you.",
        "164": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question for the government, but of course the other party can also comment. As you said it in your observations and today in the presentation, one of the legitimate aims pursued by the law is to enable potential business partners to be properly informed about the applicant's tax debts. So I would like to understand whether under the national system there are any other means, ways, through which a potential business partner may find information about another person's tax history. Thank you.",
        "165": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions which were prompted by the intervention of the representative of the government, so my questions are addressed to Mr. Tall\u00f3di, but the other applicant's lawyer may also comment on them. My first question relates to the effectiveness of the measure in question. Unless I misunderstood something, the representative of the government spoke, in fact, against measuring effectiveness of this measure, so my question would be quite theoretical, or maybe from the field of legal sociology. How one can speak about the effectiveness of the measure if that effectiveness cannot be measured? And if it cannot be measured, how it can then be proven, and how it can be asserted? Maybe you still have some data, I don't know, opinion survey, any statistical data proving the effectiveness of the measure, and if the other party wants to answer that question, maybe you have the data to the contrary, not just general considerations, but the concrete data that we could rely upon. My other question is to the representative of the government, but also to the other party, if they want to comment on that. What other publicly available list of, to use the term used already in this hall, of rule breakers, what other lists exist in Hungary that would be publicly available? Just to give several examples, traffic violators, drunk drivers, property misappropriators, domestic violence offenders, sexual offenders, medical malpractitioners, exam cheaters, state secret disclosures, bribe givers or takers, polygamists, whatever, criminals, and if such lists exist, in how many, or in which of them, the home address of a violator of the offender or potential offender is indicated? Thank you very much.",
        "166": "Three questions, two for the government and the applicant, and the other one for the applicant, but of course the government can comment. The first one is about the taxpayer identification code. The government argued that the applicant had and doesn't have a taxpayer identification code because now you talk about taxpayer identification code, but as far as I understood beforehand, it was another position. What I would like to understand is if the applicant has or not a tax identification code, a tax identification number, because if there is, I would like to understand why it is, as you have just said, more antisocial than the home address. The second question is about the availability in the search interface. I'd like to understand if it is based on the same facts, the same taxes, and the same data. That means the home address and the name and the amount of the debt. The third question is more for the applicant. You said that the tax authority has any control mechanism on the impact or impact assessment, but the government argued that the tax authority is due to the enforcement proceedings, which were unsuccessful due to the applicant's lack of any property or income. I would like to know your opinion, to have a comment on this issue. Thank you very much.",
        "167": "Thank you. I have one question for both parties and two questions for the government. My question for both the parties is about the circular mentioned in paragraph 13 of the chamber's judgment, a circular issued by the National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information on February 2012 about the illegal publication of tax data of private individual in local authorities. Did the government or the administration or the tax administration follow this circular? And I have two questions for the government. The first, on your observation before the court of last July, you mentioned in paragraph 3 the following, I quote, the attempts of a forced collection against the applicant's property and income were unsuccessful as he had no property and very limited income. Therefore, the tax debts were temporarily declared unrecoverable on 16 November 2015. End of the quotation. My first question is, if this is the case, which were your expectations by publishing the name of the applicant two months later? And my second question, does the law provide any individual assessment of the need of such publication? And if yes, which is the competent organ for this individual assessment? Thank you.",
        "168": "Thank you very much. In a way, this is the follow-up to the first question by Judge Vilanova. I'm interested if tax evasion would be committed as an offense, and you have criminal record in Hungary. This tax evasion would be recorded in the criminal record. So what are safeguards there for how long this could be kept? And are there any other safeguards in terms who could access, so that we would compare criminal records with the lists that we have in front of us? Thank you.",
        "169": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My first question is directed to the applicants who contended that the 2017 Act was not amenable to a constitutional complaint because it essentially contained the same provisions as the 2003 Act. However, from your written submissions and the oral submissions today, it would appear that the creation of the search interface in 2017 was an innovative and new aspect. So leaving aside questions relating to the scope of the case, I would like to understand, was there an effective constitutional complaint remedy available in relation to this new aspect of the 2017 Act? My second question is directed principally at the government. And I will preface the question by emphasizing that this court is not, of course, competent to apply or examine alleged violations of European Union law. However, in the instant case, the content of Hungarian national law on data protection includes, indeed, one could say it's determined previously by the 1995 Data Protection Directive and now by the 2016 GDPR, the Data Protection Regulation, which, of course, is a directly applicable measure of EU law. Given that context, can you explain what, if any, examinations of the 2003 and 2017 Tax Acts occurred in the light of the relevant EU Data Protection Acts, first when Hungary acceded to the European Union, and then subsequently in 2017 when the new legislation was updated and the GDPR was already in existence? In addition, it might be useful if the government, or indeed the applicant, if they had this information, could inform us whether the European Commission in relation to Hungary or any other of the very many EU member states who operate a similar scheme have challenged the compatibility of such schemes in relation to the GDPR. My final question is really addressed to both the applicant and the government, and it is a plea which comes from a non-Hungarian lawyer. I, after listening to your submissions orally and reading the written submissions, I remain lacking in clarity regarding the tax identification code. The applicant very usefully explained to us that the reliable taxpayers' lists doesn't use a home address. It uses a name and a tax identification code. Now, this follows on, I think, from a previous questioner. But did the applicant have a tax identification code that could have been used? And if so, why was such a code not sufficient for the purposes of one or other of the legitimate aims sought by the publication of the list? In other words, was the tax identification code sufficient to identify him in the eyes of the public? Thank you very much.",
        "170": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I come back to the government in relation to the answer to one of my three questions. I asked the question about parliamentary review of this regime in the light of EU data protection requirements because of our case law, Animal Defenders, where in relation to the margin of appreciation, the court has emphasized the importance of quality parliamentary and judicial review. Now, in the instant case, either because the applicant didn't exhaust any effective remedies or because there were no effective remedies, we have no judicial review of the questions before us. So, parliamentary review becomes quite important. And therefore, I would like to know whether either when Hungary acceded to the European Union or when the GDPR regulation was adopted, which was quite a seismic occurrence throughout all EU member states, was there any review of this tax publication regime? Thank you.",
        "171": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. A mes questions, le repr\u00e9sentant du gouvernement vient de nous dire qu'il y a une publicit\u00e9 en Hongrie en relation, donc, avec les crimes sexuels. Cette publicit\u00e9, cette information, quelle forme elle prend? Est-ce qu'on conna\u00eet le nom, bien entendu, le pr\u00e9nom de la personne condamn\u00e9e? Est-ce que nous connaissons \u00e9galement l'adresse? Est-ce que vous pouvez donner un petit peu plus de d\u00e9tails sur ce point-l\u00e0? Je vous remercie.",
        "172": "To follow up, what I was interested in was, after what time the name of a person has to be erased from the criminal record.",
        "173": "Thank you very much. I have two questions, one for the applicants and one for the government. To the applicants first, because it concerns the exhaustion of domestic remedies, you are certainly aware of our case law in this matter, and more precisely of the Akdivar versus Turkey case. In this case, summing up our case law, the court has said that mere doubts about the outcome of a case is not sufficient, and that the applicant has to prove that the exercise of a remedy would be obviously futile. Obviously futile. So in response to question number five, you have spoken about legal issues which were similar. They were similar, or were they essentially identical? This is my first question. My second question to the government, if agent, if I understood you well, you said in substance that the Norwegian state exercised the role of a mere regulator and supervisor of the activities on the continental shelf. You also pointed out to the fact that the applicants were working for private companies, and consequently, that acts or omissions by such private companies, including the non-disclosure of the decompression tables, are not to be attributed as such to the Norwegian state. This is, in a nutshell, if I understood you well, your main thesis. Well, you are certainly aware of the articles on state responsibility by the International Law Commission, the UN International Law Commission, codifying this matter, as recognized by a number of actors, including by the International Court of Justice. According to Article 5 of those articles, if an act or omission of a private entity can be attributed to the state if such entity exercises elements of governmental authority, elements of governmental authority. So my question is, do you think that this condition is fulfilled in the present case, elements of governmental authority? Thank you very much.",
        "174": "Thank you very much. I have just one question to the applicant. My question is the following. Did the applicant, immediately after his return to Germany in late May, I think it was the 29th of May 2004, undergo a medical examination? If not, and I don't think we have information that it happened, what were the reasons for not doing so?",
        "175": "Thank you. Following on Judge Lorenzen's question, this question is also addressed to the applicant in terms of the high standard of proof that's required before a violation of Article 3 can be found. And my question concerns exclusively the allegations of physical ill treatment, assault, sodomy. It's not related to the global complaints that are made in relation to Article 3. And having regard to the evidence that's there, the forensic and the medical evidence that's available, I would like to hear the applicant on whether that standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt has been met, purely in relation to the allegations of physical ill treatment. And I would also like to have the applicant's submissions, if any, on whether the circumstances of this case would require that the onus shift to the respondent state on the basis of the legal principle laid down in Tomasi. And if it should revert, then why? And of course, the state is invited, if necessary, to comment on the second limb of that question. Thank you.",
        "176": "Thank you very much, President. I have a question for the applicant. I'm sorry. And in fact, in view of the arguments given in the written submissions on page 47 in reply to question 10 put by the court, could you please elaborate on the reasons for which the applicant did not submit the witness statement to the national prosecution authorities? And in particular, on two points that you raised there. First, why do you state that that statement, the witness statement, does not contain any new facts which should first have been presented to the national authorities? And second, to elaborate on the argument that this statement was given on condition to be used only before this court, in the applicant's view in such circumstances, would it be possible for the court to use this statement? Thank you.",
        "177": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma question s'adresse \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentante du gouvernement fran\u00e7ais. Vous nous avez dit, et en cela, vous avez parfaitement raison, que nous sommes saisis d'un cas d'esp\u00e8ce et que c'est celui-ci que nous devons juger. N\u00e9anmoins, la Cour ne peut pas se d\u00e9sint\u00e9resser de l'ensemble du dispositif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans lequel s'ins\u00e8re le cas particulier qui lui est soumis. Vous nous avez dit qu'\u00e0 vos yeux, une atteinte port\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 8 \u00e9tait en principe d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables irr\u00e9versibles. J'ai m\u00eame cru comprendre, \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, et je voudrais que vous me confirmiez si j'ai bien compris, que vous estimiez que si de telles cons\u00e9quences irr\u00e9versibles devaient \u00eatre attach\u00e9es \u00e0 une atteinte port\u00e9e \u00e0 la vie familiale, elle ressortirait alors du champ d'application de l'article 3 plut\u00f4t que du champ d'application de l'article 8. Premier aspect de ma question, ai-je bien compris votre pens\u00e9e ou ai-je tort? Le second volet de ma question est le suivant. Imaginons que dans des circonstances comparables \u00e0 celles qui ont conduit \u00e0 l'interpellation de M. de Souza Ribeiro, un \u00e9tranger en situation irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re soit interpell\u00e9 en Guyane et qu'il fasse valoir, pendant sa r\u00e9tention administrative, qu'il a charge de famille, qu'il est p\u00e8re de plusieurs enfants en bas \u00e2ge, qu'il constitue la seule source de revenus avec laquelle ses enfants peuvent vivre et qu'\u00e0 ses yeux, son \u00e9loignement du territoire de la Guyane pourrait constituer une situation dramatique aux cons\u00e9quences irr\u00e9versibles. Ma question est alors double. Est-ce que le gouvernement consid\u00e8re que dans une telle situation, il y aurait lieu \u00e0 un examen particulier qui pourrait conduire, m\u00eame en l'absence de caract\u00e8res suspensifs du recours, \u00e0 faire en sorte que son \u00e9loignement n'intervienne pas avant que son recours soit jug\u00e9? Et deuxi\u00e8me point, est-ce que le mode de fonctionnement concret du dispositif policier et juridictionnel tel qu'il est \u00e9tabli en Guyane permettrait la prise en compte d'une situation particuli\u00e8re comme celle-ci?",
        "178": "Le 6 f\u00e9vrier, \u00e7a veut dire \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 10 jours apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9loignement, le r\u00e9current a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 libert\u00e9 devant le tribunal administratif de Cayenne en demandant \u00e0 ce qu'il soit fait injonction au pr\u00e9fet de Guyane d'organiser le retour en France. Et la cour a rejet\u00e9 cette requ\u00eate un jour plus tard. Ma question est la suivante, est-ce que le tribunal administratif aurait eu la possibilit\u00e9 d'examiner si la mesure d'\u00e9loignement avait des cons\u00e9quences irr\u00e9versibles, si le r\u00e9current avait fond\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate sur cet argument?",
        "179": "Thank you, President. Just a question first to the applicant. The question is, I've seen that indeed there is the right to get a titre de cejour once a person comes of age, once he is 18. In the applicant's situation, it means that on the 14th of June, he became majeur. It is also of importance, I think, that apparently you should regulate your titre de cejour as soon as possible. Why? It's just a factual question. Why did the applicant take the risk? Why didn't he go as soon as he was of age the 14th of June 2006 to the authorities to ask a titre de cejour? But then to the government, that's the next question, talking about coherence, I've seen that the applicant, when he was already of age, on the 25th of October 2006, got a sentence from the Cayenne Youth Court. So apparently the authorities did already have at their disposal all kind of information on the applicant, even when he was a majeur, because apparently he was then given by the Cayenne Tribunal de Jeunesse a two-month suspended sentence. How come that if he is, when being a majeur, being convicted by a court, a Cayenne court, that the authorities, on the other hand, a couple of months later, just pretend that he has no right to be in France Guiana?",
        "180": "Thank you President, I have two questions to the parties. One is related to the government's statement that the police officer had no way of knowing the situation of the applicant. My question is, is there a procedure or was there a certain period of time giving the applicant any chance to inform the police authorities on his actual situation so that it is taken into account by the administrative authorities prior to enforcement of the order? And my second question is concerning the decision of declaring this enforced order unlawful. Is it the case that the courts are also authorized to order, parallelly to finding such an order illegal, to order the return or explicitly indicate the applicant's right to return? Or was there any decision required, alternatively, to allow the applicant to return where he did not do so illegally? Thank you.",
        "181": "Ma question s'adresse \u00e0 l'\u00c9tat et aussi aux requ\u00e9rants. Le Conseil d'\u00c9tat a par une d\u00e9cision de novembre 2011, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la situation d'urgence peut donner aux juges des r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s aussi dans le territoire de Guyane, le pouvoir de prononcer la suspension d'une d\u00e9cision telle que celle de notre affaire. Ma question est tr\u00e8s concr\u00e8te. Est-ce que ce arr\u00eat du Conseil d'\u00c9tat a chang\u00e9 la pratique en Guyane? Oui ou non? Est-ce qu'il y a d'autres arr\u00eats, notamment des juges des r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s en Guyane, qui ont appliqu\u00e9 cette nouvelle jurisprudence? Je dis nouvelle parce que c'est la premi\u00e8re fois que le Conseil d'\u00c9tat se prononce sur les faits et sur le pouvoir de suspension que le juge des r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s peut attribuer \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision vis-\u00e0-vis le requ\u00e9rant en Guyane. Merci.",
        "182": "I have just a very brief question. It's probably primarily to the applicant. I understand that there is a possibility to lodge a claim for compensation following illegal decisions. And after the removal decision had been found illegal, did the applicant then lodge a claim for compensation with the administrative courts? And if he did, what was the outcome? Thank you.",
        "183": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions to both parties. The first question to the Georgian representative. In the relevant time, Georgia was a member of the Community of Independent States. There are some agreements regulating migration problems between these states. For example, the agreement of 6 March 1998 on the prevention of illegal migration. Also another agreement concerning cooperation of states in the field of labor migration and social protection of labor immigrants of 1994. Did Georgia participate in these agreements? This is my question. The second question, Mr. President, with your permission, comes to the representative of Russian Federation. I know that the Federal Immigration Service of Russian Federation has its representatives in many countries. I would like to know, did this service establish such representatives in Georgia in the relevant time besides the consular services? Thank you.",
        "184": "I would like to hear the parties additional views on article 38 of the convention and in particular on the circumstances, if any, when a state party to the convention can raise the plea of, say, state secret or official secret or national security in opposition to that article. How, if at all, can, for instance, national security, which admittedly can be a genuine and legitimate concern, be reconciled with a state party's undertaking under article 1 of the convention to secure to all persons within its jurisdiction the substantive rights and freedoms mentioned in the convention, in the event, of course, of a person instituting proceedings, either domestically or in Strasbourg, against that state? Thank you.",
        "185": "Thank you, President. In fact, I have one question to the applicant government and one to the respondent government. The applicant government refers to an administrative practice. Would you please specify whether this administrative practice is, in your view, restricted to Georgians for a relevant period and what period? When did it start and when did it finish? Or is it an administrative practice that continues after this period that is in the application? And as to what moment? My question to the respondent government relates to their submissions that the government of the Federation of Russia was exercising its authority to ensure a proper migration policy in the relevant period. Are you able to offer statistical data as to the percentage of Georgian nationals or ethnic Georgians that left the Federation in the period concerned in the application in previous and subsequent periods so that one may understand whether this percentage was higher or this number was higher for the relevant period as compared to earlier and subsequent ones? Would you also be able to provide information on these numbers in regard of other nationalities or aliens? Thank you.",
        "186": "Thank you, President. I have three questions to both parties. I understand that the applicant on 26th of December 2010 was detained on remand on account of the second criminal charge. But that detention was then continued on 27th December on account, inter alia, of him having failed to study the case file, of having avoided to appear before the investigator, and of having hindered the investigation. My question concerns the consultation of the case file. Is there an obligation under Ukrainian law to consult the case file? How does the allegedly incomplete consultation of the case file hinder the criminal investigation? And is it a general practice in Ukraine to sanction a person who incompletely consults the case file? Second, I understand that one day after his arrest on 27th December, the applicant was brought before the Pechersky court. He was thereby informed about the charge of the preventive measure. My question concerns the requirements of Article 5, Paragraph 3. According to this provision, a person detained on remand shall be brought promptly before a judge, and he shall first be informed of the suspicions concerning a criminal offense and of the reasons for detaining him, and second, he shall have the right to explain himself. So I would wish to ask, when was the applicant brought before a judge according to Article 5, Paragraph 3? Namely, where a judge told him first the offense of which he was suspected, and second, where he could explain himself. Third, under Article 5, Paragraph 3, a release from detention may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial. I have now heard the submissions of the applicant that 77 members of Parliament and the National Ombudsman offered guarantees for the applicant appearing at trial, apparently to the sum of about 100,000 euros. My question in the present case, in view of these guarantees, was an alternative preventive measure for the applicant adequately considered? Thank you.",
        "187": "Thank you. I have just one question to the government. The government have pleaded that the arrest was based on the allegation that Mr. Lutsenko had put pressure on the witnesses. I just want to understand how you define the word pressure. What does pressure mean? Because I understand that he had talked to the media, he had contradicted the version of the prosecutor. Is that already pressure or how do you define the word pressure?",
        "188": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. My first question goes to both parties. It follows from the document submitted that on 24th of December 2010, the investigation of the first criminal case against the applicant was renewed in order to conduct further investigative actions. And this was one of the reasons why the applicant \u2013 why the preventive measure of the applicant was changed. Were these additional investigative actions conducted in respect of the first criminal case against the applicant, or they concerned other criminal cases instituted against him and later joined to the first case? And my second question is for the applicant. You have just described the circumstances under which Mr. Fomin found out about Mr. Lutsenko's arrest. Could you please specify when exactly Mr. Lutsenko himself was informed or in other way found out that he had been arrested on 26th December 2010 in the framework of the second criminal case instituted against him? Thank you.",
        "189": "I have a number of questions. The first of all, three questions I would like to put to the government. Firstly, is it the government's argument that before an act can be regarded as a manifestation of a religious belief, as opposed to being motivated or inspired by that belief, it must be mandated by the religion in question, or at least form part of the practice of the religion or belief in a generally recognized form? If so, how is this court to determine this question in cases where an applicant asserts and the respondent denies that it is so mandated? Is this rather narrow approach consistent with that adopted by the Grand Chamber in the Leyla \u015eahin case, where the court did not examine whether the wearing of an Islamic scarf was mandated by the Muslim religion? Secondly, do the government argue that there can be no interference at all with the manifestation of religious belief in the context of employment if the applicant can reconcile that conflict by resigning and seeking employment elsewhere? If so, must the employer do more than merely assert this by showing the genuine possibility of alternative employment? If this is not the government's argument, in what circumstances would the government accept that there could be an interference? And thirdly, in the case of Mrs. Ladele, does it, in the view of the government, make a difference that at the time of her original employment, civil partnerships did not exist and that new requirements were effectively imposed on her when she was asked to perform civil partnership ceremonies? And I have one question to the counsel for Mrs. Eweida and Mr. McFarlane. Do you argue that the same approach should be adopted to the claims under Article 9 and under Article 14, whether the employer is a state authority or a private law company or association? If not, how is it suggested that the court's approach should differ when dealing with the positive obligations of the state, as in the two cases in question? I note that reliance is placed, strong reliance is placed in the written observations on this section's judgment in Jak\u00f3bski, but that, of course, was a case which clearly involved direct state intervention in the sense it concerned the prison authorities in Poland. Then I have two factual questions. The first addressed to Mrs. Eweida, is it correct that prior to May 2006, Mrs. Eweida wore a cross, but that the cross was not visible over her uniform? And then one in respect of Mr. McFarlane, was it the applicant's own choice to apply for the psychosexual therapy diploma, or was this a requirement of his being able to be employed by Relate? If the former, did he know that this would require him to give PST counseling to same-sex couples at the time he applied for the diploma? Thank you very much.",
        "190": "Thank you. My question concerns the Eweida case. And we heard and read also from the documents that the British Airways adopted in 2007 a new uniform code which allowed carrying visible religious symbols at work. And my question is whether the parties know what was the reason for the change of this policy? Was it the Eweida case? Was it the policy of other companies? Or was there something in the national non-discrimination legislation? And then we also know that 30 other staff members, they were happy with the code, or at least they followed it. And my question is whether the parties know, has the change of this code had any other larger impact other than that Mrs. Eweida could return to her work? Thank you.",
        "191": "Yes, I would like to ask a factual question in the context of what has been proposed, that employers cannot be forced to accommodate the beliefs of the religious convictions of their employees. My question, and I ask this sincerely out of sheer ignorance of what the position is in England, but is there any law in the United Kingdom which, in the context of hospital services, allows hospital employees, particularly nurses but possibly even doctors, to opt out of certain interventions, operations, whatever, on the grounds of conscientious objection? I don't know what the position is. If it was mentioned in one of the papers submitted, I apologise for putting that question again. It may have slipped, I may have not noticed it. Thank you.",
        "192": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is related to the previous questions of Judge Hirvel\u00e4 concerning change in British Airways dress code policy, symbol policy. What did it mean? This question is for both parties. Did it mean that British Airways indirectly and tacitly recognized the violation of the applicant's rights? Thank you.",
        "193": "Thank you, Mr. President. Since both parties made reference to the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, I have the following question to both parties, if you could possibly try to answer it. How does the sentencing approach to sentencing in the ICTY compare to the challenge that is brought in the case in front of us as concerns the sentencing policy, I would say? How does that compare? And the reason I'm asking is the following, because as we all know, the ICTY statute expresses verbis, refers back to the domestic law and practice in the respective countries, notably Bosnia and Herzegovina in our case. So I would be much obliged to the parties if you could compare the sentencing practice in ICTY and in the challenged cases.",
        "194": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two, in fact, three questions. The first one regards the sentencing policy of the state courts compared to the one of the entities courts. Were there in 2004 and 2007 any sentencing guidelines, any established sentencing criteria, either in the case law or in statute or any other form, that could be used by these courts? First question. Second question, which is related to this one, were there in 2004 and 2005, when these cases started, any objective criteria for the allocation of these cases to the state court? We know that in one of these cases that we have now here before us, the case was reallocated, was transferred from its natural jurisdiction to the state court. My question is, was it available at that time, at the decision time, at the moment where the decision, when the decision was taken, any criteria for this decision? So I'm talking about 2004 and 2005, when the allocation decisions were taken. Then related to this problem of the reallocation of the cases, could you provide the questions, I should have explicitly said that, are directed to both parties. Could you provide examples of any cases where the proposed replacement or reallocation of the cases was refused by the state court? Is there any example where the state court refused, rejected the reallocation of the case? And finally, and this question is suggested, has been suggested to me by the arguments presented by the applicants, are there any examples of any sentences of the state court where more lenient sentences were handed out, handed down than the sentences of the entities courts for similar facts? Is there any case where for similar facts, the state court has sentenced the person in a more lenient way than the sentences of the entities courts? Thank you.",
        "195": "I have a question to the respondent government. You said that in total, the state court rendered 102 judgments between March 2009 and November 2012, out of which only in five judgments, the state court applied the old code. Please specify how many of those 102 judgments were second instant judgments, and how many of those second instant judgments concerned only war crimes, excluding the crimes against humanity and genocide. Thank you.",
        "196": "Yes, please, I have some questions. The first set of questions concerns the reasons for the applicant's detention. So the reasons given for the applicant's detention on 5th August 2011 were that she might attempt to abscond, and I quote now, to abscond from trial, evade the execution of procedural decisions, abstract the establishment of the truth in the criminal case. It was further argued that she failed to show respect for the court and participants of the trial and breached the order of consideration of the case. In particular, she had failed to comply with instructions of the court and obstructed the process of interrogation of witnesses. So my questions are the following. Are there other cases in Ukraine in which courts have ordered pretrial detention for contempt of court? Is this a legal practice in Ukraine? And second, what is meant by the reproach she obstructed the process of interrogation of witnesses? If she just asked questions or contradicted witnesses, isn't that her procedural right on the basis of the Code of Criminal Procedure? The second set of questions concerns the transport to the hospital and thus the incident on 20th of April 2012. So my question first go to the government. Was the video surveillance of the applicant's cell never recording or was it only not properly functioning the day when the applicant was brought to the hospital? Next question, why was the prison inmate who shared the applicant's cell brought to another cell immediately before the applicant was removed? Third question, why has she been transferred to the hospital during the night after she had already gone to bed? So it was at 9.30, I think they arrived, and she was brought to the hospital at 10.40 in the night. And fourth question, in which way was the evidence obtained by the Ombudsman used by the general prosecutor when deciding about opening or not opening a criminal investigation into the incident? Then I want to know, the state authorities have given two possibilities, possible reasons for the hematomes found on the applicant's body. First, that they were self-inflicted, and second, that there were symptoms of the illness the applicant had had before already in August 2011. I just want to know concerning self-infliction, how could the applicant have self-inflicted the hematoma in prison as she was surveyed 24 hours by the video surveillance and it was never claimed that anybody has seen herself applying blunt objects against her body? And the question concerning this incident to the applicant, why has the applicant not complained about the use of force immediately when she arrived in the hospital Friday night? And why did she show the hematoma only on 24th of April, that is four days afterwards and not before? And why did she not accept a blood test to be taken after that? And just one further question concerning the lack or the denial of provision of painkillers during the court hearings. I would like to know, the applicant said that the painkillers were only given to her when she cooperated. I want to know which sort of cooperation was demanded and for how long was she denied the medicine she thought she needed? Thank you.",
        "197": "Thank you, President. I have a group of questions to begin with on the conditions of detention. And here I would begin with questions to the applicant's representatives, in particular concerning the applicant's allegations as to inhuman treatment in Kiev Detention Center Number 13. I note that the description of the detention conditions given by the applicant in the original complaint dated 5 October 2011 differs from the description given by the applicant later on received by the registry on 8th, 25th June and 6th July 2012. The descriptions differ in important aspects, for example, as the size of the cell, 16, 14 square meters, the amount of showers allowed, one shower per week, two showers per week, the necessity to ask for permission for an extra shower. I would like to ask the applicant's representatives why do these descriptions differ? Then still on the conditions of detention, I have questions both to the applicant's representatives and to the government. I would wish to know was the applicant granted privileges which other detainees were not granted, for example, concerning food parcels, parcels with bed linen, parcels with fresh drinking water and so on. Were all prisoners provided? In fact, could all prisoners be provided with food, bed linen and drinking water in a sufficient quality? And if the applicant received special treatment, why was this necessary? The next group of questions concerns the applicant's medical treatment, and here I would begin with questions to the applicant's representatives. What was the reason for the applicant not to trust the medical treatment and examination offered by the authorities? On the other hand, why did she at times accept to take the medicaments prescribed and to undergo examinations? Why did she refuse to be examined when Dr. P and her nurse were present, even though previously she had wished that this happened, for example, 3rd September and 15th September 2011? To the government, I have a final question as to the medical treatment. I note that a different assessment of the health status of the applicant was made by the prison doctors on the one hand and by the foreign doctors on the other. How can such a different assessment be explained, particularly as regards the evaluation of the seriousness of the applicant's condition? Thank you. The question was, how can this assessment be explained, particularly as regards the evaluation of the seriousness of the applicant's condition? Thank you.",
        "198": "Thank you. I have a question to the government concerning the applicant's complaint under Article 8 of the Convention. You have stated in your submission that video surveillance of the applicant in the hospital had a legal basis and pursued legitimate aim. I would like to ask you to comment on proportionality and necessity of this measure. Also, had the applicant complained to the administrative court as the government suggested she had to do? Would the administrative court examine not only legality but proportionality of the impugned measure according to relevant legislation and domestic case law? And was this remedy effective in the applicant's situation? And on this latter point, I would like to ask the applicant to comment as well. Thank you.",
        "199": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Mes questions s'adresseront \u00e0 l'agent du gouvernement. Ma premi\u00e8re question est une demande de confirmation. Vous nous avez dit, Madame, que l'orientation sexuelle des requ\u00e9rantes n'\u00e9tait pas pertinente dans cette affaire parce que, de toute fa\u00e7on, l'adoption \u00e9tait impossible en raison du refus oppos\u00e9 par le p\u00e8re biologique. Ma question est donc la suivante. Si le p\u00e8re biologique avait donn\u00e9 son accord, la Cour doit-elle comprendre qu'alors l'adoption aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible, quelle que soit l'orientation sexuelle et le sexe des requ\u00e9rantes. Ma seconde question est la suivante. Vous nous avez rappel\u00e9 que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant est un principe si important en droit autrichien qu'il a maintenant valeur constitutionnelle. Deuxi\u00e8me point, dans votre m\u00e9moire \u00e9crite au point 3.3, je lis, ma citation sera br\u00e8ve, des couples homosexuels peuvent \u00eatre pour l'essentiel personnellement, personnellement en italique, aussi appropri\u00e9s ou non que des couples h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuels pour adopter des enfants. Il en va de m\u00eame pour l'adoption d'enfants du conjoint dans les couples homosexuels. Troisi\u00e8me point, il me semble, sauf \u00e0 ce que vous me corrigiez, qu'en droit autrichien, il est absolument impossible aux homosexuels d'obtenir une adoption coparentale. En rapprochant ces trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments, c'est \u00e0 dire l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l'enfant comme but l\u00e9gitime, la reconnaissance de l'aptitude \u00e9ducative de certains couples homosexuels et enfin l'interdiction absolue qui leur est oppos\u00e9e. Est ce que ne surgit pas une question de proportionnalit\u00e9 ou de fa\u00e7on encore plus pr\u00e9cise? Et c'est sur ce point que j'aimerais avoir vos explications. Ne serait-il pas plus concevable au regard de ce principe de proportionnalit\u00e9 que soit pr\u00e9vu un examen au cas par cas des requ\u00eates pour juger pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des enfants et de l'aptitude \u00e9ducative des requ\u00e9rants ou des demandeurs \u00e0 l'adoption plut\u00f4t que de leur opposer un refus absolu et de principe? Merci.",
        "200": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question both to the applicants' representative and to the government, and it follows the first question just exposed by Judge Potocki. I would like the parties to clarify, in your submissions just now, the government said that the applicants never applied formally for a substitution of the father's lack of consent to the adoption. And the applicants just argued that the Austrian courts have denied any inquiry into reasons for replacement of father's consent because the law does not allow it. And I see a certain contradiction in these two submissions. I would be very grateful to the parties for really clarifying that. And maybe for the applicant, if you would comment in your reply in relation to the regional court's decision, in which we can read the court's reasoning about the biological father having regular contacts with the child, also the fact that the child maintains a meaningful relationship, and the court's conclusion or interim conclusion in these circumstances. However, there is no need to replace either of the biological parents. So would you maintain your submission in the light of the regional court's reasoning that there was no any substantive inquiry into the whole consent issue and the best interests of the child? Thank you.",
        "201": "I would like to ask the applicant the confirmation of the information we heard from the government. The representative of the government said about the current situation of the applicant that she is now in Australia, she has regular contact to the child and she has also worked there. What's the situation and has the mother lodged any request to review the custody and meeting rights in Australia and furthermore, has the mother the right to lodge such a reviewing case in Australia according to the law in Australia? Thank you.",
        "202": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to pose a question to the respondent government's representatives. In your view, the interference with the applicant's rights was performed in accordance with the law. When you say this, do you refer to the decisions of the courts, or do you actually involve the de facto return of the child to Australia? If you refer also to the de facto return of the child, what was the legal ground? And what do you mean by in accordance with the law in these circumstances?",
        "203": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a very short question, in fact, to both parties. Maybe you could clarify, because if I understand correctly, the decision in Australia after the applicant and the child had left, the Australian courts attributed parental responsibility as from the moment of birth of the child. Could you provide an information to the court is parental responsibility, in a sense of the decisions in Australia, the same as in the Hague Convention Article 3, the custody rights of the parents? Thank you.",
        "204": "Yes, I have a question to both parties. I would like the parties to comment on Article 20 of the Hague Convention, which provides as follows. I quote, I read it out. The return of the child under the provisions of Article 12 may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested state relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Would this be relevant in this case? And it's a question which I address to both parties. Thank you.",
        "205": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. The first is for the government. Mr. Perry, if I got it correctly, you have said that, and I quote, long-life incarceration is imposed for the purposes of pure punishment, end of quote. May I ask you whether you conceive punishment as the only purpose of a life sentence? My second question goes to the applicants. Mr. Weatherby, you allege that in this case, there would be a violation of Article 3. If I understood correctly, your written submissions, as well as your pleadings this morning, you seem to suggest that such a violation would be both procedural and substantive. Could you please analyze a bit more the nature of the violation you invoke, taking into account the case law of the court in this respect? Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",
        "206": "Thank you, Mr. President. I should like to put a question to the United Kingdom government. I should like to know whether the government have given consideration to redrafting the relevant prison service order so as to bring it into line with the explanations that the government themselves have given to the three applicants and to the court in the present proceedings in relation to the applicable law governing the exercise by the Secretary of State of his discretionary power to release under Section 30 of the 1997 Act, and in particular, in relation to the duty incumbent on the Secretary of State by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998 to take into account considerations relating to Article III of the Convention, as well as terminal illness and physical incapacity. Thank you.",
        "207": "I have a question for the government. I would like to know if the government can give a single example where the Secretary of State exercised his power of release under the 1997 Act for penalogical grounds. A single example. Thank you.",
        "208": "Could I simply extend that question and ask the government not only for examples where, in fact, the Secretary of State exercised his power to release prisoners serving a life sentence, but could you give examples of situations where it could be imagined that after some time, the continued detention becomes unjustified? So not necessarily situations that have actually occurred, but which, according to the government, might justify a release.",
        "209": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma question s'adresse plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 M. le b\u00e2tonnier Favreau. Dans le dispositif critiqu\u00e9, le b\u00e2tonnier a un r\u00f4le particulier, que l'on qualifie parfois de filtre. Est-ce que vous pourriez, notamment, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de votre exp\u00e9rience ordinale, nous dire, non pas que vous ayez connu une telle situation, bien s\u00fbr, mais votre exp\u00e9rience vous permet d'avoir un regard particuli\u00e8rement pratique sur cette question, pourriez-vous nous dire en quoi ce r\u00f4le de filtre devrait ou pourrait constituer?",
        "210": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have four questions which I would like to address to both parties. My first question concerns Judge P's power as the President of the High Administrative Court. According to section 41, paragraph 5 of the Judicial System Act of 2002, in the absence of the President of the High Specialized Court, his duties shall be performed by the first Deputy President. I would like to ask the parties to specify the term absence. In particular, if a judge's terms of office as President of a court has expired, does it mean that a President is absent as of that day, or he or she is not considered to be absent until a relevant decision on his or her dismissal is adopted? Second, what was the exact scope of review of Mr. Volkov's case in the Parliament during the plenary meeting of the Parliament, given also the very limited time the Parliament had to hear the parties? Third, the government's submission on compatibility of the applicant's dismissal with Article 8 of the Convention were concentrated on issues of legality of this measure. I would like to ask the parties to specify whether or not the High Administrative Court is entitled, under applicable legislation, to examine proportionality of the measure at issue and to set aside the impugned decision or to declare it unlawful if it considers it to be disproportionate. And finally, does absence of any time limit for proceedings on breach of judicial oaths pursue any legitimate aim, and is it justified in the state's legal system?",
        "211": "Thank you, President. I also have four questions to both parties. So the first question is, the applicant was dismissed for breach of oath. There were several reproaches in the beginning, and two were declared unlawful by the higher administrative court. So the review of decisions of a relative was not seen as a breach of oath, and also the reproach that he had not seeked the withdrawal of another judge. What remained was the reproach of gross procedural violations. We have just heard now that he had instituted cassational procedures. So I want to know, if that's considered to be the wrong application of procedural law, why is just the wrong application of the law already considered a breach of the oath? Has there to be any extra element, or is whatever breach of procedural law a wrong application of procedural law already considered as breach of the oath? Second question, the government stated that the consequences of the decision of the higher administrative court is to say that it's unlawful. The consequence would be, in the end, that the judge would be reinstated and compensated for the period during which he was dismissed. Do you have any concrete example of a reinstatement after such a declaration of unlawfulness, first? And second, in this case, it was declared only partially unlawful. So the first reproaches were seen to be unlawful. Nevertheless, there were no consequences. Would it not have been logical, then, to restart the procedure, at least in the parliament, as it was based on partial unlawful reproaches? The third question concerns the voting in the parliament. There was the video, and the applicant referred to the video. The government has stated that there was no examination of this video, and there was no conclusion of a competent authority. Do the government argue that this video does not show reality? So does it not mirror what has really happened? And if so, does it mean that it's falsified? Or what is exactly the argumentation of the government? And last question that's a little bit refers to the second question of Judge Yudkivska. In the parliament, there was a vote on the dismissal. And actually, was it a legal or a political vote? Because I understand that the parliament, they are not lawyers, or not only lawyers in any case. And it was a legal question if there was a breach of oath. So what is the function of the parliamentarians? What can they say to this legal question? Thank you.",
        "212": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have really more of a comment than a question, because when looking at the applicant's brief, I found that the claim for just satisfaction, according to Article 41, was about how much we said? 1,100,000 euros for the projection of the lost salary in the future, et cetera. What has pleasantly surprised me in Mrs. Gordon's statement now is that she maintains, and I assume both representatives of the applicant maintain, that the only proper remedy in this kind of case is reinstatement. Because under a different terminology, we're talking about an impeachment of a judge. When the impeachment procedure itself is problematic, it is clear that the reinstatement is the proper remedy, exactly as has been pointed out by Mrs. Gordon, or at least secondarily, perhaps, the repeat of the procedure, the retrial of the impeachment procedure, rather than 1,100,000 euros for a period projected up to 1,022. Now, since this is apparently a surprise coming from the applicant based on international sources of international law, I would appreciate more buffering, not buffering, more substantiation in this respect, because our own case law goes back to Scozzari and Giunta. It goes back to Assanidze. It goes back to Broniowski, the three triangle of cases which have initiated restitutio in integrum, restitution as a proper remedy under Article 41 in conjunction with 4619, et cetera. In other words, what I'm saying is, yes, I'm \u2013 I am surprised presently with this consultation on the part of the applicant as far as remedies are concerned, but I don't see that in the brief. So either you may submit that \u2013 depends on the decision of the President \u2013 either you may submit that later on, substantiating your position on the reinstatement or retrial, or you explain why is it not in the brief.",
        "213": "Merci, Mme la Pr\u00e9sidente. J'ai une question pour le gouvernement. Alors, en pr\u00e9sence de plusieurs exemples o\u00f9 les juridictions fran\u00e7aises ont op\u00e9r\u00e9 par une application directe de la Convention au niveau national, comme par exemple les arr\u00eats de la Cour de cassation de 15 avril 2011 concernant la pr\u00e9sence de l'avocat pendant la guerre d'Avue, ou l'arr\u00eat de 2 mai 2000 du tribunal de grande instance de Montpellier, qui appliqua directement la jurisprudence mazura\u00efque, je vous pose la question. Est-ce une intervention l\u00e9gislative de telle nature \u00e0 compromettre l'application directe de la Convention par les tribunaux au niveau interne, en particulier en limitant l'effet dans le temps des nouveaux droits, comme dans le cas d'Expess? Merci.",
        "214": "Merci Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente. Moi j'aimerais bien poser cette question en deux parties. Et ce qui m'int\u00e9resse serait, est-ce qu'il y a une possibilit\u00e9 que l'action en r\u00e9duction fasse un nouveau partage des biens d\u00e9j\u00e0 partag\u00e9s? Alors pas des biens, de nouveaux biens qui peuvent surgir, mais des biens d\u00e9j\u00e0 partag\u00e9s. Merci. Merci.",
        "215": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a couple or three questions to both parties. If I read the case file correctly, no VAT was levied on the transaction. And I guess this was because it was a donation. But I would like you to confirm that it would have been different if it had been a commercial transaction and not a donation. My second question is rather a hypothetical one. But I'd like to put it to you all the same. In the hypothetical event of a sale of the property by the applicants at a higher price than the original acquisition price, since it was a donation, the acquisition price was zero, or the initial valuation, would there be a tax levied on the benefit that they made in selling these properties? And the third question, and this is rather a technical detail, I'm afraid, but just for me to understand completely, there is a notarial fee paid. And as far as I understand, the fee was zero or equal to 0.35 euros. This is referred to in the government submissions. Is this the global fee paid, or is it for each donation contract? And that were all my questions. Thank you.",
        "216": "Thank you. I have two questions which may be addressed to both parties. The first is whether we could be given a more detailed description of the plots in question as in 1994, namely as in the moment of acquisition by the applicants. In particular, have there been already any hardware installation, any technical infrastructure like cranes, embankments? The government observations mention warehouse containers, stack uncovered cargo sites. But what I would like to have is a clear information of what already was on this land in the moment of acquisition. And then my second question is we know that the market value of the plots in January 1996 was respectively 9,000 euros and 5 millions. Do we have any estimate what was approximately the market value of these plots when acquired in 1994? In other words, have there been some dramatic jump in the market value within these two years or the market value already in 1994 was at least significant? Thank you.",
        "217": "Thank you. I have a question to the government and the question relates to tax reassessment proceedings. In spite of the fact that at the end the courts rejected the claims of the finance department of the Municipal Council of Riga, but my question is that the finance department asked the applicant to pay for one year, 1997, tax in sum of 18,891 and 78,382 Latvian. Now I don't know what it is in Latvian. So my question is from which value or how come the finance department to this very high tax for one year? Thank you.",
        "218": "Thank you Mr. President. My question is a follow-up to the question raised by Judge Garlicki and it is going to both parties. If you could elaborate on the use of these plots specifically in 1997 and today. What are these plots good for the operation of the harbor and whether they were considered in Soviet times to be part of the harbor because in the statement of facts there are allegations that only when the decision concerning the establishment of the free port of Riga was taken, it was at that point that these plots were prospectively, and I emphasize prospectively, taken into consideration. So I just have difficulties understanding how these plots were in the Soviet times, in 1994 and today, related to harbor operations physically and legally. Thank you.",
        "219": "Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question pour le gouvernement. L'article 2, tel que modifi\u00e9 par la loi du 19 d\u00e9cembre 1996, comporte un dernier alin\u00e9a qui vise les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de donations. Est-ce que le gouvernement peut indiquer \u00e0 la Cour si ce dernier alin\u00e9a a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres personnes que aux requ\u00e9rants?",
        "220": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. C'est une question pour les requ\u00e9rants. Selon les faits tels qu'ils sont rapport\u00e9s dans le dossier de l'affaire, la valeur indicative des biens mentionn\u00e9s dans les contrats de donation au fin du calcul de la taxe fonci\u00e8re s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 500 ou 1 000 latis par terrain, soit environ 705 et 1410 euros. Apparemment, il s'agissait l\u00e0 de la valeur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e par les requ\u00e9rants comme la valeur fonci\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la donation. Est-ce que vous pouvez \u00e9laborer un tout petit peu sur ces donn\u00e9es? Merci.",
        "221": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would have, roughly speaking, two questions. They are addressed to the government primarily, but of course the applicant representatives are very welcome to comment if they find it appropriate. And the questions really relate to the application of the Intelligence and Security Service Act or what the government has named as IVD investigations in relation to the applicants in this case. And I would really appreciate if the government were to specify more concretely what kind of threat to the national security did the applicants pose. What exactly was in their actions of such a character? Because as far as I can see, Article 6, Paragraph 2 requires a rather high threshold. So what was in their actions that endangered the national security? And if you could, in this connection, also clarify this contradiction that we have in the case file when it comes to the application of Article 6, Paragraph 2, where the applicants considered targets or non-targets on the debate in the Court of Appeal, indeed as just referred by the applicant's representative. And the second question, also linked to IVD investigations, is the government of the opinion that the minister's authorization of these special investigative activities on the basis of the Act, that the minister's authorization, or sometimes it seems that it is the head of the Secret Service, is a sufficient safeguard for the purposes of Article 8 and Article 10. I understand that you will obviously look at it in the broader picture. But I'm more interested that you address the whole issue of prior guarantees in relation to the possible interferences with fundamental human rights. Thank you.",
        "222": "Yeah, my question refers to the, directed to both the government and the application. The first one refers to the nature of these documents. I mean, these documents were in possession of the Telegraph, and whose surrender was asked by the government from the Telegraph, where they were the same original documents which physically had been in possession of the Secret Services and had been given to the Telegraph. There was a material, physical identity. The second question, also both parties, in page 11 of the observation of the government, there is reference to several investigations. There is reference to an investigation by the AIBD under section six of section two of the Intelligence Act. There is also a reference to an investigation by the National Police Internal Investigation Department. And also there is reference to an investigation by the Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. And then it says in paragraph 37 that before the start of the investigation and at the request of the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, the supervisory committee of the Intelligence and Security Service examined whether the investigation had been designed and organized in such a way as to comply with the requirement of the civil service information and so on. Well, my question is concerning the particular investigation by the AIBD using special powers, that seems to include telephone tapping. This investigation was subject previously to any kind of control or advice or authorization by the supervisory committee or by any other independent agency. That's my question because I don't get it very clearly from this government observation. Thank you.",
        "223": "Thanks, President. Indeed, on paragraph 37 of the government's observations, just to go in more detail, the supervisory committee for the intelligence and security services, the CETEVD in Dutch, is that supervisory committee, that's the first question, is that also for the applicants in general a sufficient independent body. I'd just like to hear what also the applicant thinks about the role in general of the supervisory committee. But then, indeed, the question arises, did the supervisory committee ex ante, so on forehand, not just afterwards, have a look at the special powers or not, special powers exercised? And in that connection, I go to paragraph 82 of the government's observations, where it says that where the person in respect of whom the power is to be exercised is acting in a special capacity, for instance, as a journalist, this must be stated in the request for authorization together with the reasons why it is necessary to exercise the power in this case. And there, in fact, we come to the question also asked by Judge Ziemele when a journalist, when against a journalist, looking at 82, special powers are exercised, is it indeed just the minister who, at the request of the head of secret service, authorizes or is there a special, some kind of special procedure because it is about a person in special capacity like a journalist? The last question, a question addressed especially to the applicant, as I take it, the documents in question were documents or copies of documents belonging to the secret service. They came from a secret service and whether they were originals or copies made of originals, they belonged to the secret service. So what the secret service does is, hey, these things are stolen from us or copied from us in an illegal way, hand them back. Is there anything against that? Is there anything against a surrender order when people ask something back what belongs to them? These are my questions.",
        "224": "Maybe I was not too precise in my question to the government. The question would be, any of the documents in possession of the Telegraph, did any one of them, or was any one of them, be it a paper or tape or picture or whatever, was it physically subtracted from the files of the Secret Service? I mean, they were just transferred, taken physically from the possession of the government to the newspaper.",
        "225": "Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is to the government. We've seen statistics provided in the Adams case, which indicate that in earlier days, half of the applications were considered to be discourage of justice. More recently, the figures are different or show a different trend. My question related to the statistics is, are there cases where compensation for miscarriage was provided? So Section 133 was applied in the absence of a retrial. So once again, no retrial was 133 ever applied without retrial. Secondly, I would like to know a little bit more about the conditions of retrial. What would trigger a retrial once the judgment is clashed? And finally, a question to the counsel of the applicant. Assuming for the sake of argument that Article 6.2 applies in this case, in the specific circumstances of the case, Mrs. Allen, what would, in your view, indicate that the judgment of Lord Justice Hughes was based on an assumption that Mrs. Allen is not innocent? Is there anything on record that indicates that the judgment was based on such an assumption of lack of innocence? Thank you.",
        "226": "Thank you, President. My question goes to both parties. I understand that the applicant was considered deprived of liberty based on Article 5.1a within the meaning of the convention until the moment when the Court of Appeal quashed this conviction. What is the bearing of the quashing to the legal qualification of the deprivation of liberty sustained by the applicant? Can it be considered that the period in which she was deprived of liberty falls under Article 5.1 and which of the exclusions would be applicable to her circumstances after the quashing? Thank you. for watching.",
        "227": "Merci beaucoup, M. Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai tout d'abord une question pour le requ\u00e9rant, et le gouvernement pourrait aussi commenter, bien \u00e9videmment. Ma\u00eetre, comment est-ce que vous, en tant qu'avocate, vous concevez la notion d'atteinte irr\u00e9m\u00e9diable de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s? Qu'est-ce que, pour vous, constitue une atteinte irr\u00e9m\u00e9diable? La deuxi\u00e8me question s'adresse au gouvernement, mais l\u00e0 aussi, le requ\u00e9rant pourrait commenter. Mme Niedlispacher, vous avez parl\u00e9 de la continuit\u00e9 de l'assistance, mais aussi de l'interruption momentan\u00e9e de l'assistance. Et vous avez mentionn\u00e9 que le requ\u00e9rant a eu 4 conseils belges diff\u00e9rents, mais quand m\u00eame, il a pu d\u00e9velopper une strat\u00e9gie de d\u00e9fense. Alors, ma question est de savoir, dans ces circonstances, y est-il eu vraiment une strat\u00e9gie de d\u00e9fense? Et pourquoi 4 conseils diff\u00e9rents? Qu'est-ce qui s'est pass\u00e9? Est-ce qu'on a une id\u00e9e? Pourquoi est-ce qu'on a d\u00fb, donc, changer si fr\u00e9quemment les diff\u00e9rents avocats du requ\u00e9rant? C'est une question factuelle. La troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re question s'adresse aussi au gouvernement. Lors de votre plaidoirie dans l'affaire Lhermitte, vous nous disiez que l'accusation, l'acte d'accusation constitue la pi\u00e8ce ma\u00eetresse de la proc\u00e9dure, que les jur\u00e9s, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque dans l'affaire Lhermitte, mais le cadre juridique est plus ou moins le m\u00eame, si je comprends bien, que les jur\u00e9s avaient probablement d\u00e9j\u00e0 form\u00e9 leur opinion avant l'audience sur la base de l'acte d'accusation, et que cet acte d'accusation ait d'une grande importance pour que l'accus\u00e9 comprenne les raisons de sa condamnation en l'absence de motivation du verdict des jur\u00e9s. Bref, vous avez soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque l'importance centrale de l'acte d'accusation. Et ma question est la suivante. Est-ce que vous estimez que l'acte d'accusation a eu la m\u00eame importance centrale dans cette affaire? Merci beaucoup.",
        "228": "Just one question to counsel for the government. Some emphasis has been placed on the fact of the extradition proceedings in France and then the criminal trial in Belgium and that he was what happened as far as waiver of the rights in France and then what happened in Belgium and in between the two interviews which took place. Is the government's position, or is the government suggesting in any way, and I ask this simply for clarity's sake, is the government suggesting that the extradition proceedings in France and the criminal proceedings in Belgium are to be considered as one continuum as far as the right of the accused to legal assistance is concerned? That is my only question, thank you.",
        "229": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My question is for the respondent government. In your initial observations to the court, the written observations, you indicated that uncertainty remained regarding whether Mr. Gworth had already met his lawyer when he was questioned by police on the 11th of January 2008. In your oral observations today, any doubts seem to have been dissipated. But could you specify when a lawyer was formally designated to Mr. Beuze, and I mean designated, not simply requested, on what date, and if possible, for how long the applicant consulted with that lawyer for the first time, and in particular, whether this was prior to the 11th of January questioning? Thank you.",
        "230": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question au gouvernement. Donc, je voudrais savoir, est-ce qu'il y avait des contradictions essentielles entre les diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9clarations de M. Beuze lors des interrogatoires ou auditions qui ont eu lieu sans une pr\u00e9sence physique d'un avocat? Bien s\u00fbr, la partie r\u00e9currente \u00e9galement peut faire des commentaires. Merci.",
        "231": "Thank you, Mr. President. I first have a question to both parties. As just referred to by my colleague, Judge Sicilianos, in the case of Lermitte versus Belgium, the court explained that to some extent, when viewing jury reasoning as presented by the judges, one would perhaps to some extent view the way in which the court of cassation has viewed that reasoning. One can be informed by the court of cassation as to the reasoning of jury deliberations. On that basis, we have a court of cassation judgment in this case. Can I ask both parties to assist me in whether I'm reading the court of cassation's judgment in the case where the applicant presents arguments on the basis of Article 6? The first is, do I read the court of cassation judgment correctly that in its findings that the fairness of the proceedings at first instance or in the Assisi court were fair, the court of cassation did not base its conclusions on the fairness that statements of the applicant during police custody or pretrial investigation had not in fact been used or been the basis upon which the jury made its conclusions? I don't see it. I just want to be clear that what I see from the dossier, the court of cassation did not make that finding by its own reading of the jury reasoning that that was excluded as a possibility, that the jury might in fact have had as its basis for some of its views the statements provided by the applicant during the proceedings. Related to this, I see that in the reasoning of the jury as set out by the court as to the indicted part as regards the attempted murder of Christian Lacroix on the 17th of September 2007, the jury reasoning states, the defendant had deliberately arranged to be alone with a pregnant woman. Now here, of course, this is just a statement of a proven fact. The basis upon which the evidentiary material relied upon is not stated. What I do see, however, from the dossier, and here comes my question, in an interview or the interrogation by the criminal investigation police on the 25th of March 2008, the applicant acknowledged that he had invited Christian Lacroix, then pregnant, to get into his car. He stated that he had punched Christian Lacroix in the face to protect her from a possible encounter with Madame Boudard that had been planned, and so forth. So do we have before us, because this is the reasoning of the jury, can you point out to any other piece of evidence which could have formed the basis for the jury's finding on this issue, that the defendant had deliberately arranged to be alone with a pregnant woman? Is there any other piece of evidence? Do we have any reason to think that it is other piece of evidence than the testimony provided by the applicant himself? Just a clarification on that issue. Thank you.",
        "232": "I'd just like to expand on the question of Judge Spano and just one point related to the jury and the conclusions that the jury is drawing. Could the court made a conclusion that the jury was not relying if the jury was not given specific instruction upon that, without giving the instruction to the jury? Could then the court rely? And then to expand on the question related to the lawyer and the contacts between lawyer, the specific question was asked for this one particular date, 11th of January, 2012. But I think this question is actually pertinent to each questioning of our applicant. When the lawyer was present, to what extent he could consult with him. And when the lawyer was not present, to what extent did he consulted with him outside of the interview? It's important for each questioning. Thank you.",
        "233": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have one question to the applicants and three questions to the government. The first question to the applicant, the applicants are from Bangladesh and requested asylum in Hungary. The basis for their request must be, I assume, the risk of ill treatment in their country of origin, which is Bangladesh. In their observations before the court, the applicants have provided the court with some information about their personal situation and the alleged risk of ill treatment in Bangladesh. But my question is, did the applicants also explain to the Hungarian authorities the basis for their fear of ill treatment? If so, when and to whom did they do so? More specifically, were they given a chance to do so by the Hungarian authorities? And were they also questioned by the authorities on this issue? When I listened to the representative's intervention addressing the question of arguable claim and fear, if I did not misunderstand it, it was only with reference to Serbia and Greece, but not in relation to Bangladesh. My first question to the government concerns Serbia as a safe third country. The applicants did submit a request for asylum in Hungary, but the Hungarian authorities relied on Serbia as being a safe third country. Is it correct to conclude that Hungarian authorities never assessed the applicants' request for asylum under merits, that is, the risk of ill treatment in a country of origin, but limited its assessment to Serbia being a safe third country? If so, why was their assessment limited to Serbia? Was it the result of a legal prescription or a standard practice? Furthermore, were the applicants asked by the Hungarian authorities about their fear of ill treatment in Bangladesh, and if so, when and by whom? My second question to the government concerns the possible consequences in case the applicants had left the transit border area. One of the issues of dispute between the parties is the question of the possible consequences in case the applicants had decided to leave the border transit zone before having received a final decision on the request for asylum. According to section 62, paragraph 2, subparagraph D of the Asylum Act, the authorities may discontinue the proceedings of a request in case the asylum seekers leaves his place of accommodation for more than 48 hours. Furthermore, according to section 66, paragraph 6 of the same act, an asylum seeker may, within the time limit of nine months, request the continuation of a request for asylum. Therefore, my question, is it correctly understood that if the applicants had left the border transit zone, the processing of the request would have been discontinued? And are there any examples in practice where the authorities have decided, on the basis of a request from an asylum seeker, to continue the processing of a request that has been discontinued? My last question to the government is the following. The Hungarian authorities relied on Serbia as being a safe third country. According to the government, the authorities did so on the basis of a general assessment of the situation in Serbia, as well as an assessment of the applicant's individual situation. My question is, are there any examples in practice, in particular during the relevant period in 2015, where Hungarian authorities exceptionally have reached the conclusion that Serbia was not a safe third country, or was Serbia, in all cases, regarded as being a safe third country? Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "234": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question follows the last question of my learned colleague, Judge Kj\u00f8lbro. And it is directed to the government, but the applicants can, of course, provide information and opinion. The question is, section 2 of the government's decree 191, 2015 provides for a list of countries to be considered safe for purposes of removals of asylum seekers. Then the question is, how safe is this consideration as safe countries, especially if we consider that the Balkan route, including Serbia, was facing very high migrant fluxes in the summer, autumn 2015? I invite you to consider as well paragraph 48 of the EU procedures directive as to the update of this information. The second question, this court in Sufi and Elmi has defined the sources of information for the purpose of qualifying a safe country of destination, being third or original country. In conducting their assessment, should national authorities and eventually this court rely in other sources of information on the country of destination situation, such as, for example, credible media reports? Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "235": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have short questions, better to say comments. I would like to hear comments of both parties concerning the concept of so-called inherent limitations on personal freedom and liberties introduced by the government, Hungarian government in their written submissions and in the presentation of this morning. More precisely, in the course of the legal qualification of the measures on which applicants had been subjected in the transit zone, government is invoking the concept of inherent limitations of personal liberty. Can you say a little bit more precisely what does it mean, specifically in the context of the court's jurisprudence, court's case law regarding the Article 5 of the convention? Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "236": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. Just, I have one follow-up question, which is prompted by the pleadings of the government this morning and follows one of the questions posed by my colleague, Judge Kj\u00f8lbro . There is a crucial element in this case, and that is the implementation by the Hungarian authorities of the safe third country concept. In 2009, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe issued guidelines on human rights protection in the context of accelerated asylum procedures, where the safe third country concept is developed. One of the criteria mentioned for the appropriate application of that concept is that the third country, in our case, Serbia, will admit the asylum seeker. Now, this seems to be, and now here comes my question, and I would like your comment on this. In section 51A of the Asylum Act of 2007, which was in force at the time of the proceedings, it stated as follows. If the safe country of origin, which we're not dealing with here, or the safe third country refuses to admit or to take back the applicant, the asylum authority shall withdraw its decision and shall continue the procedure. Now, my question is, Mr. Tall\u00f3di, you said this morning that the readmission procedure had not been triggered. So may I ask, on what basis were the Hungarian authorities in conformity with 51A of your Asylum Act? To what extent were there assurances made that Serbia would, in fact, readmit the applicants on the facts of this case, and therefore, to what extent, if your answer is that no such readmission was made explicitly by the Serbian government, how that would conform with the implementation of this safe third country concept. Thank you.",
        "237": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question \u00e0 l'avocate des requirants. C'est une question concernant un point plut\u00f4t formel, mais quand m\u00eame, vous avez inform\u00e9 la Cour que vous n'avez plus de contact avec vos clients. Et l\u00e0, mes questions. Est-ce que vos clients, les requirants, ont connaissance de l'arr\u00eat de la Chambre et du renvoi de l'affaire devant la Grande Chambre et du condamne de votre dernier contact avec les requirants? Et derni\u00e8re question, pourquoi pensez-vous que malgr\u00e9 la perte de contact avec vos clients, la Grande Chambre devait poursuivre l'examen de cette affaire? Et bien s\u00fbr, le gouvernement peut aussi se prononcer sur ce point. Merci.",
        "238": "Oui, j'aurais une question \u00e0 l'avocate des requ\u00e9rants. Quelles \u00e9taient les pers\u00e9cutions concr\u00e8tes? Vous avez parl\u00e9 des pers\u00e9cutions des requ\u00e9rants en Serbie. Et quelles \u00e9taient vraiment les pers\u00e9cutions concr\u00e8tes? Et puisque la Serbie est aussi un pays membre du Conseil de l'Europe et de la Convention, pourquoi les requ\u00e9rants n'ont jamais essay\u00e9 des recours juridiques en Serbie? Merci.",
        "239": "Thank you, President. I have two questions for the government, but the applicant can also comment if they wish. So in your observation, your government relied on paragraph three of article seven of the Reception of Asylum Seekers Act, which is the only exception to inapplicability of provision for extension of material assistance for Dublin asylum cases. But article three, in fact, allowed this extension on the basis of special circumstances relating to respect for human dignity. Now, in the very detailed instructions issued by FEDASIL in July 2012 on withdrawal of material assistance, we just heard from you that, yes, this instruction was not applicable in 2011. But to the extent this instruction reflects a summary of relevant practice, what was meant under these special circumstances? It is not clear from the instruction. Could you please specify the FEDASIL practice in this respect? What exactly was meant under special circumstances for the purpose of paragraph three of article seven? And my second question, what was the exact legal ground on which FEDASIL finally provided the applicants with accommodation on 5th and then on 7th October 2011? Thank you.",
        "240": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je vais poser 2 questions. Elles sont destin\u00e9es principalement aux requ\u00e9rants. Bien entendu, rien n'emp\u00eache le gouvernement de donner sa r\u00e9ponse. En ce qui concerne la 1re question, c'est la suivante. Quelle \u00e9tait l'implication exacte du requ\u00e9rant dans l'agression du 29 mai 2006? Je vous prie de donner tous les d\u00e9tails possibles quant \u00e0 son degr\u00e9 de participation personnelle dans ce d\u00e9lit. Et la 2e question est la suivante. Est-ce que le requ\u00e9rant avait la possibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir la nationalit\u00e9 danoise avant sa condamnation p\u00e9nale de 2009? Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, pourquoi n'a-t-il pas exerc\u00e9 ce droit? Je vous remercie, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "241": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have three questions. The first one is addressed to the government. The government is arguing that the Papashvili test, as reflected in paragraph 183, does not apply and cannot be transposed to persons suffering from mental illnesses, as, in the view of the government, it only applies to persons suffering from physical illnesses. Assuming that the government is correct in its assumption, what is or should, in the view of the government, be the relevant test to be performed by the court? Is the protection under Article 3 to be limited to cases where there is a risk of self-harm or suicide? I did not find the government's position very clear on this point. My second question, both parties, as well as all the third parties intervening before this court, have addressed and discussed the test established in paragraph 183 of the Papashvili judgment, including how to apply it to persons suffering from mental illnesses. From some of the interventions, in particular the intervention from the UK government, referring to the judgment from the UK Supreme Court, it transpires that the Papashvili test, as formulated in paragraph 183, may give rise to some uncertainty when it comes to the right interpretation, and therefore also when it comes to the correct application of the test. Therefore, my question is, in the view of the government, is that does the test in practice, or has the test in practice given rise to problems of interpretation and in the affirmative, which elements of the test have given rise to uncertainty? My third and last question is to both parties. In this case, the question of removal or expulsion of a foreigner suffering from an illness arose in the context of criminal proceedings, more specifically when the domestic courts, under section 58 of the Aliens Act, were called upon to assess amending the committal order and at the same time the question of revocation of the expulsion order. In other words, in this case, Article 3 concerns a foreigner with a prior lawful stay in Denmark. However, the issue of removal of a foreigner suffering from an illness, be it physical or mental, may also arise outside the context of criminal proceedings, in particular when assessing requests for residence permits under section 9B of the Aliens Act, based on humanitarian grounds, which, according to the preparatory works as well as domestic practice, would include an assessment in conformity with Article 3 of the Convention, including Pappersville. Now my question, is it correctly understood that whatever the court may say in this case concerning the expulsion of a foreigner with a prior lawful stay would also apply equally to cases concerning requests for residence permits, I'm referring to persons without a prior lawful stay in Denmark? Thank you.",
        "242": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. Judge Kj\u00f8lbro's questions related mainly to Article 3. Mine may be of relevance if the court undertakes an analysis of Article 8. In the applicant's case, a permanent ban on reentry was imposed. And my questions are as follows. Is there provision under Danish law for the application of a temporary ban on reentry? And if so, in what circumstances would it be applied? And could the High Court in 2015 have amended the permanent reentry ban imposed by the High Court in 2008 to a temporary one? And if so, on what basis? My second question, and these questions are for both parties, is what was the degree of the applicant's dependence on his family in Denmark when he became an outpatient from 2014? Where did he live? With whom? We know now from the submissions of the Danish government that he continued to receive a disability pension. But was he otherwise socially or financially dependent on his family? And the reason for this question is because I didn't find these factual details elaborated in the decision of the High Court of 2015. Thank you very much.",
        "243": "Thank you very much. I have two questions which are on a factual nature, which can be addressed to both representatives, both parties. The first question is, the applicant was assigned a curator at Liethem in the domestic proceedings for the revocation of the expulsion order. In domestic law, in this case, did this mean that the court considered he lacked mental and legal capacity to take decisions and to defend himself in these proceedings? The second question concerns some factual discrepancy, which I found in the assessment of the psychiatrists at the first stage during the criminal conviction proceedings and in the revocation proceedings. The psychiatrists in the revocation proceedings concluded that the applicant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia during the period of commission of the crime. This is in contrast with the report of the medical legal counsel at paragraphs nine and 10 of the chamber judgment, which had been submitted to the court for the purposes of the criminal proceedings leading up to the conviction. The first report had concluded that the applicant did not suffer from a mental disorder at the time of the commission of the crime, that he was mildly mentally retarded, and that his complaints of auditory hallucinations could be regarded as simulation. So my question is this, would it have been possible under Danish law to order the applicant's expulsion had the correct diagnosis of diminished mental capacity been submitted at the stage of the proceedings leading to his conviction? Thank you.",
        "244": "My thanks to the parties regarding the clarification on the issue of permanent and temporary bans and this new information regarding a 2019 law. Could I ask the representative of the government to develop a little bit on this question of the law permitting differentiation regarding re-entry bans with reference to what criteria or in what circumstances does it permit differentiation? Thank you.",
        "245": "I just would like to follow up when it was decided to expel Savran outside of Denmark. Would it be possible if he would not be expelled at that time just to leave him and to free him from the institution in Denmark? So whether he was at that stage where he could be released actually from the institution.",
        "246": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to add on the question posed by Judge O'Leary and to inquire from the government agent more clarification on whether the change in the laws of 2018 which have been elaborated on by both sides would allow nowadays the applicant to apply nowadays for reconsideration of the length of the ban. Thank you.",
        "247": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais seulement poser une question aux deux parties concernant leur opinion. Si le r\u00e9cr\u00e9ant a coop\u00e9r\u00e9 ou dans quelle mesure il a coop\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9alisation du parcours propos\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s de mois d'ao\u00fbt 2017 jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour, en particulier en ce qui concerne le suivi psychiatrique? Merci.",
        "248": "Merci. J'aurais trois questions aux requ\u00e9rants, s'il vous pla\u00eet. La premi\u00e8re question, c'est... Je serais int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Quelle \u00e9tait la souffrance concr\u00e8te du requ\u00e9rant \u00e0 cause du fait de ne pas avoir de traitement psychiatrique? Est-ce qu'il y avait des angoisses ou des vraies crises qu'un psychiatre aurait pu soigner? Ou bien \u00e9tait le probl\u00e8me plut\u00f4t qu'il n'y avait pas d'espoir ou de pr\u00e9paration pour \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9? Et la deuxi\u00e8me question, c'est alors pendant ses 14 ans, est-ce qu'on lui a offert un traitement, m\u00eame en fran\u00e7ais, qu'il n'a pas accept\u00e9? Ou est-ce qu'on n'a jamais essay\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler avec lui dans cette langue? Et est-ce que les co\u00fbts des tenues \u00e9taient alors trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment? Et la troisi\u00e8me question, c'est... Est-ce qu'\u00e0 votre avis, la situation serait diff\u00e9rente si M. Roumane ne parlait pas l'allemand, une langue officielle de la Belgique, mais disons l'espagnol? Est-ce qu'il n'y avait pas les m\u00eames probl\u00e8mes de traitement et de socialisation? Et est-ce qu'on ne devrait pas accorder les m\u00eames droits \u00e0 quelqu'un qui parle une langue non officielle qu'\u00e0 quelqu'un qui parle une langue officielle? Merci.",
        "249": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Mes questions sont des questions de suivi \u00e0 mes coll\u00e8gues, qui sont mises en 2 parties. D'abord, le gouvernement nous dit que M. Romain n'avait pas besoin d'un suivi pharmacologique, mais on a un rapport d'expertise psychiatrique fait par le Dr. R en 2005 qui nous pr\u00e9cise que le suivi psychoth\u00e9rapeutique doit suivre le traitement bas\u00e9 par des m\u00e9dicaments psychotropes. Donc, on a ici, quelle est la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le plan de traitement de M. Romain. Et une deuxi\u00e8me question est toujours li\u00e9e \u00e0 ce plan de traitement qui \u00e9tait propos\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but par les psychiatres, qui proposait une r\u00e9\u00e9ducation cognitive de M. Romain. Et ma question est la suivante. Est-ce qu'une fois qu'on a eu la possibilit\u00e9 d'avoir une interpr\u00e9tation en allemand, et surtout apr\u00e8s 2017, est-ce qu'on a expos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Romain ce plan ou est-ce que la psychologue qui est venue, comme le requ\u00e9rant le soutient, elle a mis seulement des questions sans lui exposer le plan qui pourrait aboutir dans certaines conditions \u00e0 son \u00e9lib\u00e9ration? Merci beaucoup.",
        "250": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser une question au gouvernement. Vous avez parl\u00e9, madame, du lien entre le motif de la d\u00e9tention et la maladie du requ\u00e9rant. Bien \u00e9videmment, ce lien est \u00e9vident. Moi, je me demande si l'on peut parler du lien entre la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9tention et du but de la d\u00e9tention. Est-ce que vous pensez que le but de la d\u00e9tention est seulement un but social pr\u00e9ventif ou aussi un but m\u00e9dical th\u00e9rapeutique? Merci.",
        "251": "Thank you very much. I would have one question to the applicants and two questions to the government. The question to the applicants, if I see correctly the timeline, on 19th of July 1997 there was an application for a bankruptcy procedure but it failed because the money was not paid. Two years later on 1st July 1999 the Fokker came into force and after that on 22nd of November 2000 there was a confirmation in court that the claim, that there was a final judgment concerning the claim by the railway company and only one year later there was a strike off. So at the moment when the judgment of the court concerning this claim from the railway company was handed down, what was the expectation of the applicant, what would happen to this final judgment? Because I understand the hope or the expectation that there would be ex-offizio bankruptcy procedures was not possible anymore because Fokker had entered into force at that time. So what was the expectation, what would happen with this final judgment? And now concerning the government, my first question is, you have argued that it was impossible to serve the decision about the striking off to the individual company members. But if it's impossible, the whole system is built on the idea that later on enforcement procedures would be directed against the individual members of the company. So if it's impossible to serve already the striking off, how do you then expect it to function within the enforcement procedure? And my second question to the government is, I understand that you treat in the same way minority shareholders and majority shareholders. So if somebody has 11% as the applicant or has 100%, there would always be this personal liability. So do I understand it correctly that if a company has just one member who has 100%, a creditor would get one debtor? And if the company has, let's say, 10 minority members, then the creditor would immediately get 10 debtors. So is that the system? Have I understood it correctly? Thank you.",
        "252": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to begin with a question to the applicant, and it's prompted by the pleadings by the government here today, where the agent for the government refers to the pleading made at paragraph 100 of your observations, where the applicant says he does not contend that a shareholder's personal liability for the outstanding debts of the company is per se incompatible with the convention. Now, that prompts the question on how would the applicant invite the court to draw the line? What are the parameters for convention compliant application of FOCA and non-convention compliant application of the FOCA? And in particular, is it the applicant's view that member states are precluded for imposing personal liability on shareholders in limited liability companies outside the context of abusive conduct? Could you clarify where you think the line under the convention should be drawn? My second question, if I could just get a clarification, and it goes somewhat to the question just posed by Vice President Nu\u00dfberger, that is the one year vacatio legis on the facts of this case. Now, it seems undisputed that the applicant could have within that period proceeded with triggering bankruptcy proceedings or the winding up. Could you explain your view on the argument presented by the government on that issue? One question to the government, which is a related one. The government says that paragraph 76 of your observations, and I think here is a crucial point in light of your submissions. The point here is that only persons who had rights to manage or participate in the management of the company at the time when the company was struck off without liquidation could be held liable. What do you mean by rights to manage or participate in the management of the company? Are you limiting this view to those that actually hold board member status or director status like the applicant? Because the issue of who has the rights to manage can be dealt with in different ways. Could you clarify what you mean by this term? And are you including there minority shareholders who indeed have rights, for example, to call a general meeting? But as the constitutional court in your own country states in its judgment of 9 October 2002 at paragraph 43, minority shareholders do not have an obligation to influence or have a view on day-to-day regular operations in limited liability companies. Could you clarify what you mean by rights to manage or participate in the management of a company? Thank you very much.",
        "253": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une seule question factuelle qui se pose depuis la plaidoirie de la partie requ\u00e9rante, de son premier intervenant, mais la question s'adresse \u00e9galement au gouvernement. Si j'ai bien compris, l'avocat du requ\u00e9rant a dit que la responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle des associ\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite par la loi de 1999 appel\u00e9e FOCA. Selon mes notes personnelles, mais l\u00e0, je peux me tromper, et vous pouvez alors me corriger, moi, j'avais not\u00e9 qu'en 1993, la loi sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s... Il y a une nouvelle loi sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s avec une possibilit\u00e9 pour les associ\u00e9s disposant de plus de 10 % des parts de demander la dissolution et la mise en faillite en cas d'insolvabilit\u00e9 avec, en cas d'omission, responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle. Donc est-ce que cette responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite en 1999 ou est-ce qu'elle existait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans la loi de 1993? Merci beaucoup. Merci.",
        "254": "Thank you very much. I have two questions to the applicant and to the applicant's representatives. The first regards the factual background of the personal involvement of the applicant in the outcome of this procedure. First, why did the applicant not himself lodge an action before the competent court to be dissolved under the Companies Act of 1993? Secondly, why did the applicant not withdraw from the company, as provided again by the Companies Act of 1993? Third, why did not he profit from the adversarial procedure by appealing the court procedure? And finally, why did he not lodge a constitutional complaint against the strike of decision immediately after the decision, but only a year later? My second question to the representatives or applicant regards this reference to the two erasure, so to say two erasure procedures in the history of Slovenia. First, the erasure of the former Yugoslav citizenship, and the second, the erasure of the companies. And here, the representative or applicant referred to the Kuric versus Slovenia case. How can you explain to us the difference between the decisions of the Constitutional Court regarding the erasure of citizens and the erasure of the companies? Because basically, at the same time, the same composition of the Constitutional Court found unconstitutional the citizenship law, and also the government acknowledged its illegality. Most at the same time, the Constitutional Court upheld the FOCA law. And so I would like to have an explanation for that. My question is to the government. First, because here we have heard that the 2.5% of the population was affected by the FOCA law. Are there perhaps any statistical data on that? How many persons have been held liable? How many persons have been held liable under this veil of the lifting of the corporate fur for debts of struck-off companies when the FOCA law was in force regarding this issue? My second question to the government would return to an issue that was raised during the deliberation by the applicant's representative, and this is the retroactive application of the FOCA law. If you could elaborate on that question, I would be very curious whether it was retroactive or not. Thank you very much.",
        "255": "Thank you very much. I would like to ask two questions, one primarily to the applicant. The applicant has argued extensively about the fact that he was not informed of the hearing relating to the strike of proceedings, nor about the decision that had been taken by the court. My question is, what would have been the possibility for the applicant to argue before the court or on appeal? And that has something to do with the text of Article 25 of the FOCA. Is there any possibility for the court, or was there any possibility for the court to come to an other decision, taking into account that for 12 consecutive months, there had not been any payments by the company? That's the first question. The second one relates somewhat to what the government said at the very end of its argument. We know what the situation is of the applicant, but there were also other shareholders who have also been held personally liable in the proceedings against the railway company. Was it possible, is it possible for the applicant to turn to the fellow shareholders or to their heirs and obtain some part from them, the part of what he had to pay to the railway company? And if so, how would then the individual responsibility of each of the shareholders be determined in the proceedings between them? Thank you.",
        "256": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would have two questions for both parties and one question just for the government. And the first question concerns the so-called irregularities or respect or disrespect of the principle of good corporate governance. And this is a disputed issue between the parties since the applicant says in his observations of 15 December that the applicant did avoid committing any irregularity under the company law and that he also behaved with the diligence required to a private individual who is a minority shareholder of a limited liability company. In paragraph 197 of the observations, the applicant even says that not even the government claimed that the applicant actually committed any irregularity in the management of the company. But on the other side, the government in its observations of 15 December denies that by saying that it has drawn attention to how the applicant should have and could have acted. Separately from the element of active membership, which is, in my opinion, a relevant element for the assessment of proportionality, eventual irregularities or serious professional misconduct are relevant, too, for the assessment of proportionality of interference in the light of the Institute of Lifting the Corporate Whale. For example, the chamber's judgment in this respect in paragraphs 125 and 126 mentions rather very broad elements, such as inadequate capitalization, failure to observe the law and good business practices, prolonged state of insolvency, inactivity of the part of the company's management, and in much more concrete terms, the chamber's judgment mentioned the failure to institute bankruptcy proceedings. So my question is, what were the concrete specific, although the most important, irregularities or serious professional misconduct caused by the management of the company before the strike-off proceedings were initiated? And my second question, which is related to the first one, is, what could the applicant do in order to avoid liability for the debt of the company? Apart from bankruptcy, missed opportunity for the bankruptcy proceedings, is it correct to say that the applicant could simply have withdrawn from the company? And by doing so, he would have avoided liability, as this is claimed by the government in its observations from 15 December under paragraph 76. In this respect, in the paragraph 76 on page 30 of the government's observation, the government relies on a decision of Ljubljana High Court mentioned in the footnote 86. But this decision relates to a legal situation under the law which was enforced in 2009, while the applicant's company was strike-off in 2001. So my second question is, what could the applicant do to avoid being liable for a company's debt? And this is relevant, in my opinion, from the standpoint of the standard of excessive burden, as this being part of the proportionality test. And finally, I have a very short question only for the government. Was there any particular reason that legislator did not introduced the model of somehow limited liability of the members of the company? Because it seems that the law introduced unlimited liability of the members of the company.",
        "257": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have several questions for the government. My first question is why the applicant was put in custody in December 2003, for the first time when she was put in custody, and why she was kept for several days in custody for identity verification. Is that a regular procedure when you perform identity verification to keep someone in custody for several days? Second question, what happened to the remaining 15 videotapes, and why they never heard at the trial? And third question, how it's possible, how come that the police failed to test the applicant's hand for residue? As far as I know, that is a standard procedure to prove connection between subject and object. And why witnesses of her search in a police station were never heard at the trial before the court? Thank you.",
        "258": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the applicant. In paragraph 48 of applicant's observations to the grand chamber, it stated the following. I quote, the applicant's motion to examine witness A. as the trial was not dismissed by the trial court. Please explain the grounds for this statement. Thank you.",
        "259": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for both sides. What were the procedural mechanisms available to the defense to ensure presence of witness A. at trial and his examination? And did the defense make use of all these mechanisms?",
        "260": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is addressed to the government, but of course the applicant may also comment on it. I would like to know why the fingerprints on the packages, alleged packages of explosives were not taken. It seems that these packages and the alleged explosives were destroyed, no sample was taken. So is it a practice that the material evidence is destroyed by police before the trial takes place? Why is it that witnesses B. and K. were not included in the list of witnesses to be summoned to the trial? They were not even included in the list of witnesses to be summoned to the trial hearing. Is this the practice that these so-called attesting witnesses are not even called to the court? And the final point is the one that was raised by the applicant with regard to the interpretation in the light of the Russian case law, the Russian Supreme Court's case law of Article 281. If I understood correctly, I'm not sure that I understood correctly what was proposed to us by the applicant, but if I understood correctly, he was arguing or she was arguing, the applicant, that Article 281 was not even applicable because the witnesses were not even summoned. So for the purposes of this article, they could not and should not even be considered as absent because they were not even summoned. Is this so? Is this in line with the Russian Supreme Court's case law? Because then we are talking about a totally different legal scenario. So these are my questions. Thank you very much.",
        "261": "Thank you very much. I have one question to the applicant. Apart from the fact that Mr. A, according to your submissions, organized video surveillance of the applicant, what other his actions, if any, could qualify his role as agent provocateur? Thank you.",
        "262": "Thank you very much. This is a question to the applicant. The government in its written observations to the Grand Chamber in paragraphs 41 and 44, and again in paragraph 104, suggested that the record shows that the acceptance by the applicant's lawyers and by the applicant herself for the record of the statement of witness A. to be read amounts to a waiver. Are there any further submissions you want to make in response of that? And also address the point why the Grand Chamber should not take as a point of admissibility and therefore declare this case inadmissible? Thank you.",
        "263": "Thank you. I have just one factual, well, legal question to ask either party or both parties. As the law stood in 2008-2009, was there a time limit within which the prosecutor's decision, like the decision of 7 August, could be overruled by a higher public prosecutor? Was there a time limit within which this could be done, or was it open-ended? There may be the information in the submissions, but if there is, I have missed it out completely. So that is why I put this question for clarification. Thank you.",
        "264": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question \u00e0 poser au requ\u00e9rant. Parmi les arguments, il a invoqu\u00e9 l'affaire Kossowski de la Cour de justice de l'Union europ\u00e9enne. Ma question est la suivante. Est-ce que le but et la nature du principe n\u00e9o-byzantinisme dans les deux cours est similaire ou diff\u00e9rente? Et dans quel respect? Merci beaucoup.",
        "265": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question en partie. L'ouverture des poursuites pr\u00e9vues par les articles 270 et 273 du Code de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale, tel qu'en vigueur \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque des faits, constitue-t-elle un recours dont il faut tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider si une d\u00e9cision est d\u00e9finitive? Merci.",
        "266": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser une question \u00e0 le gouvernement. Peut-\u00eatre que je n'ai pas bien compris, mais dans vos plaidoiries, et aussi dans vos observations en \u00e9crit, vous parlez toujours d'une d\u00e9cision qui, \u00e0 votre avis, n'\u00e9tait pas finale. Ma question est donc, est-ce que la Cour sera justifi\u00e9e de proc\u00e9der sur la base d'une affirmation du gouvernement que la d\u00e9cision est une condamnation? Vous \u00eates d'accord avec le r\u00e9cr\u00e9ant que la d\u00e9cision est bel et bien une condamnation, mais votre d\u00e9saccord est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la question de savoir si ce condamnation \u00e9tait finale. Merci beaucoup.",
        "267": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question, I think, primarily for the government, but the applicants can also, of course, reply to it. The government said that deprivation of liberty is characterized by a number of objective and subjective elements. And I would like to link that to an element that has been invoked by the applicants, namely the fact that their passports were retained. You did not speak about that when you were discussing the elements, but then I would like to ask you, is this an element that is relevant? And if so, would it be possible to explain to us a bit more about the rules that govern the taking and the returning of passports? Which are the categories of persons of which the passports can be taken, and what are the circumstances in which passports are returned to them? Thank you.",
        "268": "Thank you. My question follows Judge Lehman's question, whether the passport was claimed back by the applicants and whether the authorities refused to do that. I also would like to clarify that. I would thank both parties for their very valuable information was given to us regarding the domestic law, especially. My question is about the domestic law. The applicants' representative mentioned about the 24 hours rule when the person, when he illegally entered the territory of the Russian Federation. He should apply for this. But isn't you apply this rule or refuse to apply this rule for the present case in a mechanical way, I would say, or formalistically. I would ask you what would be the consequences that if the applicants would not comply with this rule, would not apply within 24 hours. Whether we can use this provision of the domestic law in this situation, because they were in the urgent situation, for example, as a criterion which could be used. The second question is about the difference. Would you provide the example that the Syrian family was granted asylum and provided the opportunity to have access to social services and so on, which was provided by the Russian authorities in 2015. But can you accept that there is a difference between the situations of the applicants in this case and those Syrian family? And my question is about whether the applicants arrived in the Russian border with their families or not. And the last question is about the application in the third countries. Both parties mentioned that. And my question is whether there is a requirement under the domestic asylum procedure, for example, when the person apply for asylum, should the authorities question about his previous experience and application in third countries, whether the applicant should provide any documents. And if not, if the documents are not provided, whether this failure to inform the country authorities about the third country's application, it leads to the delay in examination of the application of the asylum seeker in that case, in this case, in the Russian Federation. So I mean, the question is whether there is, there are any circumstances that could prove that the delay was also provoked by the applicants themselves. Thank you.",
        "269": "Thank you, Mr. President. I also have some questions to the government, but the applicants' representative is most welcome to also address them if they so wish. The first question is also a follow-up to the question by Judge Lemmens and Dedov concerning the passports. According to the applicants, the Russian authorities seized their passports. In their observations, the government have argued to the contrary. Therefore, my question is, were the applicants' passports seized at any time by the authorities? And if so, what was the legal basis for doing so? And what was the purpose of the measure? More specifically, was it a precautious measure to ensure the necessary traveling documents at the moment the applicants would have to leave Russian territory? Furthermore, did the seizure in practice prevent the applicants from leaving the country in case they should so have wished to do? My second question to the government concerns the distinction between genuine asylum seekers and ordinary migrants, which is one of the core arguments of the government. And the government argues that the applicants were accepted for assessment under marriage and were dismissed after rather lengthy proceedings. Therefore, in view of the government, can the state's obligation under Article 3 and under Article 5 be depending upon the outcome of the asylum proceedings, more specifically as regards material conditions for the stay in the airport zone? The government is arguing that it had no positive obligations under Article 3 to meet the applicants' basic needs during this period as they were not genuine asylum seekers. However, whether they were entitled to international protection or not was exactly what Russian authorities had undertaken to assess. So once again, my question is, can the state's obligations towards asylum seekers depend upon the outcome of the asylum procedure? My last question also to the government concerns the open door argument. Under Article 5, the government is emphasizing the fact that the applicants were free to leave Russia at any time and that nothing prevented them from leaving Russian territory earlier. In other words, the government is invoking an open door argument. However, my question is, how realistic is this suggestion in view of the fact that the applicants claimed that they risked ill treatment in a country of origin, a claim which the Russian authorities accepted to examine under marriage, and apparently no other country was willing to accept them? Furthermore, no steps to facilitate such an acceptance would appear to have been undertaken by Russian authorities. Thank you.",
        "270": "I would have two questions. First one to the government. Which concrete measures the authorities could have taken if the risk of serious disturbance of public order and the danger to the safety of individuals had persisted for a longer period than only some hours? Let's say, for example, during a sports event or a political demonstration lasting two days. Is there any possibility under Danish law for persons causing such a risk or danger who are not willing to keep the peace to be detained for one or two days if they have not yet committed any criminal offense? And a second question to both parties. According to the government, all applicants before the events of 10th October 2009 had been arrested several times in connection with other football unrest. How often have they actually been arrested and under which circumstances?",
        "271": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. The government in this case argues that either Article 5, Paragraph 1b or c or both are applicable. The applicant seems to argue in the first place that none is applicable, leaving aside that issue of applicability or not, and assuming for a moment, as the government argues, that either Paragraph 1b or c is applicable, and so that preventive detention in the circumstances of this case of a crowd control is possible. I would like to ask the parties to come back to an issue that they both have discussed. It is the question of guarantees in such a situation where, again, I repeat, it is assumed that it would be possible in theory to have such a preventive detention. And I would like specifically to ask the parties what they would think of two issues. One is in a situation of crowd control where there is a whole group that might be causing a risk to public order, what about the possibility of singling out a few individuals? What are the risks against arbitrary action in this respect? And the guarantees against, I'm sorry, what are the guarantees against arbitrarily singling out specific individuals? And secondly, I know that both parties have discussed this, but I would like to hear it again. What about the guarantees of judicial control in a situation of a preventive detention? Should it be something automatic? Should it be something that is possible within a very short time? What is the time limit for the court to decide? And how to organize all that in a practical way? Thank you.",
        "272": "I would like to ask the government to explain how the authorities determined the time when the applicants should be released. The government said that they were released when the risk was minimized. I see from the facts that the last disturbance took place at 10.51 and especially at 11.21 p.m. and the first applicant was released at exactly after this, at 11.27. The second applicant was released at 11.34, just almost immediately after the last disturbance took place. What does it mean? How did the police determine that there was no risk immediately after the clashes took place or just because the six hours time already elapsed at that moment? I have a general question to both parties and especially to the government. Whether if the detention was governed by the Article 5, Paragraph 1C, so whether the guarantees against the arbitrary detention applied in accordance with the court's case law. I mean that the concrete circumstances should be taken into account by the authorities, not the general assumption. So my question is what was the concrete circumstances which allowed the authorities to conclude that the risk, the imminent risk exists and the concrete persons, namely the applicants in the present case, would like to participate in the disturbance and the disorder. Thank you.",
        "273": "Thank you, President. I just wanted to follow up on Judge Ranzoni's question. We have heard that the applicants had been arrested before in other circumstances. Was this registered? Is there a register where you can find this information? And then we understand that the police force chosen for the arrests was a regional police force knowing these people. So they had some specific knowledge of the people and at the same time we find in the preparatory work to the law the statement that former behavior should not be relevant. So for me it would be interesting to understand what was the relevance of the former arrests for the arrests in this case to both parties. Thank you.",
        "274": "Thank you very much. I would like to pose three questions or questions on three different aspects of the case. The first one relates to interception. Now, I understand that in order for this interception to, bulk interception to operate, there must be in place a permanent technical facility or gateway which is installed in the fiber optic cable system, which permits the intelligence services to access transmission flows in a direct manner. And of course, we understand that this interception facility may be activated on the basis of a warrant. What I would like to ask is who controls the actual, let's say, activation or deactivation of the connection to the interception facility? That is to say, who activates and deactivates the actual flow of communications toward interception? Are the intelligence services themselves directly in charge of, let's say, turning the interception facility on and off? Or is there some other intervening body at this stage? The second question regarding the interceptions phase that I would like to pose concerns cloud services. So is it correct to assume that documents, photos, et cetera, which are saved in a cloud service that is based outside the UK would be regarded as an external communication for the purposes of the RIPA regime, RIPA 8.4 regime? My second line of questions is about the interception and my questions concern the warrant and the certificate that are required for the 8.4, the RIPA 8.4 regime. Now, I note that the applicants in their joint submissions, paragraphs 120 to 122, argue that, in fact, there is a rolling program of indefinite authorization in place. And this argument is based on two things. The first point is that the bulk interception warrant can be renewed without any limits. It has a limited duration, but it can be renewed without any definite limits. And the second point they make is that the ISC has reported that only a single certificate has ever been issued, a single certificate expressed in very general terms. In other words, what the applicants, as I understand, contend is that there is, in fact, sort of a continuous recycling of a standard kind of warrant and a standard kind of certificate. Now, I would like to know if the government is able to confirm or refute this or to offer any other comments. And the third issue I would like to address are the safeguards that are applicable after the interception. Now, we understand that the data which will be included in the index of documents that will be available, potentially available for examination by a human analyst, that data is identified through the application of simple selectors and more complex search terms. We also note, however, that in a report from 2015, the Intelligence and Security Committee of the Parliament noted that from the evidence we have taken, it appears that neither ministers nor the commissioners have any significant visibility on the selection and the application of the simple selectors or the search terms that are deployed. And I also understand that it is the case that the selection for human examination of the content of communications is carried out by the analysts themselves, who will be in charge of conducting the examination. That is to say that the analysts themselves are also in charge of determining the criteria for selection. Now, I would like to raise two questions in this context. Would it be possible to explain to us which are the safeguards that are in place in relation to the selection and the application of the selectors and the search terms that are applied to the data once it has been intercepted? And also, secondly, what are the safeguards in place to ensure that data which is not selected for examination and is due to be discarded, that such data might be subject to analysis with a view to identifying potential communication patterns, which could be of intelligence value? So which are safeguards applying to the data which is retained but not selected for human examination? In this context, I also note that or assume that as regards the filtering criteria and the selectors, there is a possibility for the commissioner and possibly the other supervisory organs to conduct an exposed review or supervision. But is there any body that is empowered to issue any binding instructions or orders regarding the selectors or filtering mechanisms that are used or may not be used? So is there any sort of more robust regime for controlling the kind of selectors that are, in fact, applied, given that in the first place, it is a matter for the analysts to determine the selectors? So these would be my questions. Thank you very much.",
        "275": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question, which is addressed to the government. When considering the general safeguards in relation to the destruction of intercepted material, as soon as it is no longer, I am quoting, necessary for any of the authorized purposes provided by the section 15.3 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, and section 15.4 provides the relevant definition of the term necessary for the authorized purpose. This includes the rather broad reference to retention being necessary if, and again I quote, it is likely to become necessary. What safeguards, if any, are there to limit and or supervise the application of this criteria? Thank you.",
        "276": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have three questions. The first is turning to the safeguards relating to related communications data intercepted under a Section 8-4 warrant, which Mr. Eadie explained again this morning. And we've seen in the written observations that the safeguards provided by Section 16 of the Act don't apply. And of course, the submission is, as I understand it, that they don't apply, at least in part, because if they were to apply, it would be more difficult or impossible to make the Section 16 safeguards work for content data, in that it would make it more difficult or impossible to determine whether material was, in fact, referable to an individual known to be in the British Isles. If one, however, looks at the definition of communications data set out in Chapter 2 of the 2015 Acquisition and Disclosure of Communications Data Code of Practice, can the government explain to us why any other than the most basic traffic data would be required in order to ensure that the Section 16 safeguards can be applied effectively? And secondly, what safeguards are there to ensure that any communications data are not necessary for this purpose? And I'm thinking particularly of service use information or subscriber information, insofar as that's captured, is, in fact, discarded and or is only otherwise used in a manner compatible with the requirements of the Convention. The second question relates really to a factual clarification, I hope, of the reading of the Interception Code of Practice, the 2016 version. Looking at the protection of journalistic sources under Article 10, could you confirm whether paragraphs 4.28 to 4.31 of that code are said also to apply to confidential journalistic material, despite the clear distinction drawn in paragraph 4.26 between confidential journalistic material on the one hand and confidential personal information on the other, and the apparent limitation of those paragraphs to, I quote, confidential personal information, end quote, or quote, confidential information, close quote? And finally, the applicants made no oral submissions this morning in relation to the complaint under chapter 2, in relation to chapter 2, section 22 of RIPA. Could I just ask for confirmation whether that continues to be pursued? Thank you very much.",
        "277": "I have a question for the government. Staying briefly with Chapter 12 of the Interception Code, is it the government's case that paragraph 12.5 of the 2016 Code addresses the concern expressed by the IPT in paragraph 53 of its December 2014 judgments, and I quote from the judgment, there ought to be introduced a procedure whereby any such request, a request in absence of a RIPA warrant, if made when referred to the Secretary of State, must address the issue of Section 16.3? Thank you.",
        "278": "I would like to ask a question related to acquisition of communications data that is regulated in Chapter 2 of RIPA, which sets out the framework under which public authorities may acquire communications data from CSPS. And I'm asking that question to the government. The three questions related to that issue that were not sufficiently dealt with in submissions and are related to how the regime that is envisaged in Chapter 2 is actually satisfying the requirements of being in accordance with the law and or necessity. In particular, when we consider the large number of relevant public authorities and or purposes, the lack of independence of the designated person, and the apparent absence of any guidance related to the examination disclosure other than to the third states, acquisition and or destruction of communications data. This is the question related to Chapter 2, as I have said. Also in terms of the admissibility, the government is proposing that we should deviate from the conclusions that we have taken, that the Court has taken in the Kennedy judgment, suggesting that IPT proceedings now represent sufficient remedy. Kennedy judgment was based on burden versus UK. Is the government suggesting that IPT is representing better guarantees than the regular courts in the UK? Or is the government suggesting that in general we should not adhere to burden versus UK anymore? And could government substantiate in more details why we should do that? How many times IPT made suggestions to the Parliament and the Parliament followed that? And could you explain, is this what you are suggesting in accordance with the sovereignty of the Parliament and is following that doctrine? So we have heard the question related to the warrant and for how long the warrant and whether the warrant could be actually extended indefinitely. The same question goes for the retention of data. There are limits for the retention of data, but it seems that the retention could be prolonged indefinitely. So how that could be justified. And then, I don't know whether you can say that, but actually all the connections that are going on under the surveillance or we know that some of the connections are not under the surveillance through which internet is going. And then, if the warrant is issued for national security purposes, could the data later on be reviewed for other purposes that are identified in law? And is the purpose of economic well-being in accordance with the Convention standards? Thank you.",
        "279": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have four questions. The first one is addressed to both parties and concerns the repartition of the burden of proof and the standard of proof. I would like to hear the view of both parties on the issue of the burden of proof in this case and of the standard of proof applicable to this case. My second question is also addressed to both parties and concerns the judgments of the Czech Constitutional Court, which recognize the right to conscientious objection in respect of vaccination. Are these judgments self-executing, or do they require implementing legislation? I would like to hear the view of both parties on this issue, whether this right can be asserted without implementing legislation, or does it require legislation which would enable to assert this right to conscientious objection. Now, the third question is also addressed to both parties. The policies in respect of vaccination vary from one state to another. There are states which introduce mandatory vaccinations. There are states which base their policies upon positive incitements and recommendations. Are there any statistical data which would enable us to evaluate the efficiency of both approaches and the spread of the different diseases in the context of mandatory vaccinations and the context of the opposite policy based upon incitements and recommendations? And finally, the fourth question, which is addressed mainly to the government, maybe the applicants would also like to comment on this issue. What are the precise targets concerning the immunization level among the population in percentage to eradicate the nine diseases which are on the list of diseases in respect of which there is an obligation to vaccinate? Are there precise numbers concerning the level of herd immunity which is necessary to be reached in order to eradicate the disease? And are there differences among the nine diseases which are concerned by this obligation to vaccinate? Thank you.",
        "280": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question for the government, one question for the applicants, and one question for both. The first question, in its judgment, the Constitutional Court of Czech Republic, in its judgment of 3rd February 2011, decided that the protection of individual autonomy requires that, exceptionally, the persons concerned not be forced to undergo compulsory vaccination. My question is follow. Have there been any concrete cases in which children were admitted to preschool facilities without having vaccinated according to existing law? And the second question, it relates to Article 9 of the convention. Had the children been vaccinated, what repercussions would this have had on their, on children's and their parents' beliefs under the Article 9 of the convention? And third question, you all know that vaccination could provoke some health complications. Who would be responsible for the costs of the treatment necessary in relation to those complications? Thank you.",
        "281": "Thank you, Mr. President. So I have two questions. One already my colleague, Judge Wojtyczek, asked. And I think, I hope that my questions for government and particularly for Mr. Prymula, maybe he as a medical expert will be able to spread the light on this. First, of course, I would like, it will be interesting for me to know if there is some research comparing the situation in both situation, the countries where it is a mandatory duty in vaccination and in the countries where it is not mandatory. Whether we have a research-based statistical data so that the mandatory duty in mandatory duty country, the situation is better. And what is the result of that? And the second question, if how the children who are not vaccinated can infect the ones who are already vaccinated and they have immunity? Because when we are speaking about the interest of children who have to be vaccinated and the interest of others. So I would like to know you as a medical expert, can you explain us? If they are vaccinated and already they have immunity, how the other ones who are not vaccinated can be dangerous for them? Thank you.",
        "282": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to address both parties, the government and the applicant, concerning two issues. The one is, the first one is about the best interest of the child, and the second one is about the question of necessity that you have already dealt with. Now, with regard to the best interest of the child, I was wondering who decides on what is the best interest of the child. The question means, to what extent do parents' rights play a role over here? On the other hand, what happens if the parents' attitudes divert from scientific evidence, including recommendations given by the World Health Organization? Now, let me turn to the question of necessity, which is also relevant to both parties. I was wondering, if I go through all of the different vaccinations, they have different mechanisms, and I'm sure that the expert will be able to elaborate on that. I would like to ask the question, why is vaccination of young children against hepatitis B necessary or not? After all, it seems to be transmitted via blood contact, a risk that does not seem to be that high in preschool. So I would like to appreciate your comments on that, especially since the expert, Mr. Primolov,has referred to measles and pertussis. However, we have seen that we have nine vaccinations over here, so I would be interested in hearing what are the reasons for the mandatory vaccination of tetanus and diphtheria. To what extent does it protect the health of others? You have referred extensively to herd immunity, so you may want to elaborate a little bit on to what extent the single vaccinations contribute to herd immunity. Now, with respect to the applicant, you have made the argument that the mandatory regime does not provide for any kind of exceptions. I would like to hear... You were questioning the necessity with regard to all vaccinations. So let's turn to poliomyelitis, for example, or measles. To what extent would allowing exception be contrary to the aim of providing protection against these kinds of diseases? Thank you very much.",
        "283": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have two questions for the government, but of course the applicants are very welcome to comment on this if they so wish. My first question refers to the list of compulsory vaccinations, namely how is this list actually drawn up? In particular, I'm interested in hearing what are the criteria to include or not to include a specific vaccination on the list. In this particular respect, my question is a little bit similar or continues the question of my colleague, Judge Seibert-Fohr. In this particular respect, I'm also interested in the procedure of drawing up such a list. In particular, what is the role of experts? How is their independence from conflict of interest guaranteed? And how are any critical views taken into account when drawing up such a list? My second question pertains to the issue of compensation of those children who suffer certain negative consequences from compulsory vaccinations. It is my understanding that up to a certain point, the Czech law, the Czech legislation provided for such compensation. Later on, this was no longer the case. However, if I understand correctly, there have been some very recent developments which, according to the applicants, set very high threshold for such compensation. I would like to hear from the government, but of course the applicants are also welcome to comment, what are or what were the reasons to first abolish such compensation in case of such consequences, to reintroduce it again, and what are the reasons to put a specific threshold in this particular respect? Thank you so much.",
        "284": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai 3 questions. La 1re dirig\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avocat qui repr\u00e9sente M. Pavlichka, apr\u00e8s, donc, une question dirig\u00e9e au gouvernement et, finalement, donc, une question qui int\u00e9resse les 2 parties. Ceci n'obstant, rien n'emp\u00eache, donc, qu'il y ait des r\u00e9pliques, donc, \u00e0 la question pos\u00e9e et aux requ\u00e9rants et au gouvernement. Donc, venons-en, donc, \u00e0 la 1re question, qui est celle dirig\u00e9e, donc, aux requ\u00e9rants. Pour autant que je sache, et \u00e7a int\u00e9resse, une fois de plus, M. Pavlichka, il s'oppose, donc, \u00e0 faire vacciner ses enfants contre 3 vaccins, la poliomy\u00e9lite, l'h\u00e9patite B et le t\u00e9tanos. Or, il appara\u00eet que M. Pavlichka a, dans le pass\u00e9, fait vacciner ses enfants. Est-ce que cette d\u00e9marche est compl\u00e8tement coh\u00e9rente? 2e question, celle dirig\u00e9e, donc, au gouvernement et notamment, donc, \u00e0 son expert. Est-ce qu'on conna\u00eet le pourcentage d'effets secondaires graves, j'insiste, graves, dans le cadre de la vaccination obligatoire? Et enfin, donc, une question dont je veux agr\u00e9er aux 2 parties. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de la Convention d'Oviedo et, notamment, ce qui int\u00e9resse les interventions m\u00e9dicales. Est-ce que, \u00e0 votre avis, la vaccination constitue une intervention m\u00e9dicale au sens de la Convention d'Oviedo? Je vous remercie.",
        "285": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question primarily for the government, but of course the applicant can, or the applicants can also reply. It refers to what the Constitutional Court held in its judgment of 2015, where it stated that vaccination represents an act of social solidarity, and each individual must undergo vaccinations in order to protect the health of society as a whole. And you ended your pleading by referring to this statement of the Constitutional Court and by adding that there is a shared responsibility, that is, including an individual responsibility. I have two questions. The first one is the following. The Convention protects individual rights. That's the system of the Convention. Now how does social solidarity or a shared responsibility relate to those rights in the Convention system? Is that a sort of a fundamental duty that exists apart from the rights, or is it just an argument to demonstrate a justification under the Convention of limitations to rights? And the second related question is how far does such an individual responsibility or an individual solidarity go? What are limitations, if any, to such a responsibility of citizens in society? And you could apply that to what is at stake here. Can individuals be expected or even be required to contribute to a system of general prevention of diseases? Thank you.",
        "286": "Merci beaucoup, M. le pr\u00e9sident. C'est une question que je veux... Une question que je voudrais reposer \u00e0 l'expert de la R\u00e9publique tch\u00e8que. A ma question de savoir quel \u00e9tait, plus ou moins, le pourcentage d'accidents graves alli\u00e7ant donc avec la vaccination obligatoire... Il m'a r\u00e9pondu, il me semble avoir compris que, selon lui, il y avait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 226 accidents graves, donc par an, en liaison avec la vaccination obligatoire. Pouvez-vous donc confirmer ce chiffre-l\u00e0? Pouvez-vous \u00e9galement dire qu'est-ce que vous entendez par accidents graves? Et \u00e9galement, c'\u00e9tait ma question principale, le pourcentage, donc 226 cas par an, mais par rapport \u00e0 quel nombre approximatif de personnes vaccin\u00e9es. Le pourcentage, et qu'est-ce que vous entendez exactement par accidents graves? Je vous remercie.",
        "287": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser une question aux requ\u00e9rants. Je voudrais poser une question aux requ\u00e9rants et plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 M. Riza. M. Riza, vous avez pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'affaire comme un cas banal, quotidien, de coop\u00e9ration entre agents de police. You said, I'm quoting you in English, a trivial case of cooperation between police officers. Thats what you said. Est-ce que le transfert... Ma question, maintenant. Est-ce que le transfert... Pas de probl\u00e8me. Je disais, M. Riza, que vous avez pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'affaire comme un cas banal, comme un cas quotidien de coop\u00e9ration entre agents de police. Vous avez dit, en anglais, je vous cite: \"This is a trivial case of cooperation between police officers.\" Et ma question est la suivante. Est-ce que le transfert d'un dossier judiciaire \u00e0 une autre entit\u00e9 pour que celle-ci exerce son pouvoir de sanction p\u00e9nale, un pouvoir souverain par excellence, peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un simple cas de coop\u00e9ration polici\u00e8re? Merci M. le president.",
        "288": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question essentially for the Turkish government, but of course both the Cypriot government and the representative of the applicants are welcome to comment as well. Both in their observations before the Grand Chamber and also today during the hearing, the Turkish government asserted that there was no valid request for extradition of the suspects. Regarding the extradition request relied upon by the government of Cyprus, the government of Turkey claimed that there is no evidence of communication of that request through proper diplomatic channels. If the course of events in respect of that extradition request renders that request invalid in the eyes of the Turkish government, I would like to ask what would be a proper diplomatic channel under the circumstances. Thank you very much.",
        "289": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have one more question of clarification, which is prompted by an argument intimated by Mrs. Montgomery just now. And it is mainly to Mrs. Montgomery and also to the government of Turkey, Mr. Talmon, but I would invite Mr. Riza also to comment. In your pleadings, Mrs. Montgomery, you referred to the issue of Rasyon-i-Loki of Turkey and you mentioned that in your view, the jurisdictional link was clear, and I quote, based on the Markovitsch principles. Might I ask you to clarify, because that element I don't see from your written observations, I assume you're referring to the Grand Chamber judgment in Markovitsch and others versus Italy of 2006. Could you explain in your view how that case comes in to the equation of a possible recognition of jurisdiction by Turkey? I would also invite Mr. Talmon,, because Markovitsch and others is only referenced in footnote 45 of your written observations. If I'm not incorrect, there is no further reference. Could you explain what bearing that case, and in particular, paragraphs 53 and 54 of the Grand Chamber judgment on the jurisdictional link, of course, mutatis mutandis, would have in this case, considering the fact that Turkey indeed, or the TRNC indeed, instituted an investigation? The question arises, does that suffice to trigger the jurisdictional link under the Markovitsch principles? I would ask Mr. Riza if you have a view on this as well. It would be very useful, thank you.",
        "290": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'aurais 2 questions. La 1re pour la requ\u00e9rante. Ma\u00eetre, lors de votre plaidoirie de ce matin, vous avez \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un r\u00e9gime de surveillance plus restrictif dans le cas d'Antonio Rosset, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 notamment sa tentative de suicide du 1er avril et de l'intoxication alcoolique du 25 avril. Avez-vous pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cet argument pr\u00e9cis devant les juridictions nationales? Si oui, devant quelles juridictions? Avez-vous plaid\u00e9 durant la proc\u00e9dure interne la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de r\u00e9\u00e9valuation de la situation d'Antonio lors de son retour \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital psychiatrique le 25 avril de l'an 2000? La 2e question va au gouvernement. Vous avez \u00e9voqu\u00e9, Mme, je vous cite, qu'il n'y avait aucun risque de suicide. Et vous avez dit que la Chambre a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa version des faits de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente par rapport \u00e0 celle des juridictions nationales. Je vois que le tribunal administratif de Coimbra a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que malgr\u00e9 le risque de suicide d'une personne chez qui on a diagnostiqu\u00e9 une maladie mentale comme celle du fils de la requ\u00e9rante, au cours des derniers jours, ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, l'int\u00e9ress\u00e9 n'avait montr\u00e9 ni comportement ni humeur susceptible d'amener le personnel de l'h\u00f4pital \u00e0 penser que le 27 avril 2000 serait diff\u00e9rent des jours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Est-ce qu'il s'agit d'une version des faits diff\u00e9rente ou d'une \u00e9valuation diff\u00e9rente du degr\u00e9 de gravit\u00e9 de la situation ou du degr\u00e9 de risque de suicide? S'agit-il donc d'une version ou d'une sorte de d\u00e9naturation des faits ou d'une \u00e9valuation diff\u00e9rente des faits \u00e9tablie par les juridictions nationales? Merci.",
        "291": "Thank you, President. I would be interested in the security measures taken. It's not only possible to commit suicide with a train, but there are many different possibilities or dangers. So I would be interested to understand better the security regime of the hospital. In general, for example, with belts, were belts prohibited? We hear that there was a pavilion, but perhaps there were windows where there was a danger of people throwing themselves out. So I would like to know, were there general other security measures in place to prevent suicides from happening? And the second question goes to both parties, also concerning security measures. The first suicide attempt was on 1st of April, and after that, on 21st of April, he was allowed to go home. And as I understand, he himself wanted to go home and the family accepted him coming home, and the hospital also accepted it. Were there any security measures taken allowing him to go home? Because there were a lot of dangers, possible dangers for him already during that period without any surveillance to commit suicide. Thank you.",
        "292": "Thank you, President. I have two questions for the government and one question for the applicant. For the government, I listened carefully to the oral pleadings of the government and I was expecting a response to the first question and the fourth question. The first question of the supplementary questions put recently refers to the regulatory framework compelling hospitals to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of patients' lives. And the question is related, of course, to the regime applicable to this person. Today we have listened to the government saying that it was en regime ouvert. The government said le r\u00e9gime therapeutique a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi, la prise de m\u00e9dicaments et l'accompagnement par une \u00e9quipe pluridisciplinaire en r\u00e9gime ouvert. So it's clear for the government, this is my question, that on the 27th it was en r\u00e9gime ouvert. This is the first question. But the government also says that \u00e7a ne signifie pas que les autorit\u00e9s reconnaissaient le risque de suicide des patients. En effet, l'h\u00f4pital sous Br\u00e9aucid disposait de proc\u00e9d\u00e9s sp\u00e9cifiques pour prot\u00e9ger la vie des patients contre le risque r\u00e9el et accentu\u00e9 de suicide. Dans ces conditions extr\u00eames, un r\u00e9gime de contention pourrait m\u00eame \u00eatre suivi avec une vindication ad\u00e9quate, une surveillance renforc\u00e9e ou m\u00eame l'isolement. My question, which repeats the first question put in the supplementary questions list, is the following. What is the legal basis of this r\u00e9gime de contention? What is the legal basis of this r\u00e9gime de contention which includes l'isolement? Is the government aware of the 2011 guidelines of the Director General on Health, Francisco Jorge, which determines the measures that can be taken in all Portuguese psychiatric hospitals, all hospitals in fact, not only the psychiatric but also other hospitals, in order to prevent the risk for life, any serious risk for the patients who put their own safety or the safety of others at risk? These guidelines provide in paragraph 9 that each hospital should have its own internal guidelines. I read each health care institution should define within the scope of this orientation a standard of internal performance on the use of restraint measures in accordance with the specificities of the care it provides. And of course it refers to what is stated in subparagraph K with regard to environmental restraint, meaning the use of changes that control the mobility of the patient. It could, for instance, include confinement to a room, a closed or limited space where the patient can wander safely with clinical supervision. So the question is very clearly, what is the legal basis for this regime de contention? Is the government aware of these guidelines from 2011 which refer to this regime de contention? The second question to the government refers to the explanation, it's the fourth question of the supplementary questions. The question was stated as follows. Is there any explanation as to why there is no clinical record from 4 p.m. on the 26th of April to 8 a.m. on the 27th of April in the medical file? Now I'm particularly interested in the fact that there is no risk assessment. There is a column in the medical file which refers to grau de dependencia, degree of dependence. This is the risk assessment made by the medical doctors. The most recent risk assessment that we have is from the 2nd and the 3rd of September, 1999, and it refers to a degree of dependence level three, which means the most serious, the most imminent risk. Can you provide any explanation as to why there is no clinical record during this period of time, especially after the 25th of April, regarding the risk assessment of this patient? Now my question to the applicant, you refer to a document authored by Professor Carlos Fernandes, which you say that has been joined to this file, to the file of the court. Well we went through the file and we don't find this document. If Professor Carlos Fernandes, who I believe is here, would be so kind as to inform the court of the content of this document and what happened to this document. Was it taken into account at the national level or not? Because we don't know. We know nothing about this document. It seems that it's an expertise, but we don't know the content and we don't know the destiny that was given to this report, to this document. If you would be so kind as to explain, to summarize for the court the content of this document, we would appreciate it. Thank you very much.",
        "293": "Thank you, Mr. President. Not to prolong the proceedings too much, but I have one question which was prompted by the pleadings this morning and to some extent by the question posed by my colleague, Judge Sicilianos. One of the questions presented to the parties in this case, a crucial question, is how would you invite the court to assess the facts as established by the domestic courts? In other words, in what position is this court at this point to call into question or interpret differently the factual findings by the domestic? And it's on that basis that I want to pose this question. I present it first and foremost to the applicant, but I would invite the government to answer as well. We have two judgments in this case, the first instance court in Cumbra and then the Supreme Administrative Court. I will cite, and I want your reaction to this finding of the Supreme Administrative Court in the language as translated for us by the government. And this is on the second to last page of the Supreme Administrative Court's judgment. There the court says, despite the possibility of suicide being permanently part of mental disorders such as those that were diagnosed to Antonio Jose, in the days preceding the fateful one, there was no attitude, no behavior, or mood on his part which could arise the suspicion that that day would be different from others. Indeed, as has been already mentioned, the episode of drunkenness occurred on 25th April 2000 was merely an irresponsible behavior, which was normal and in line to Antonio Jose's alcohol addiction. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the suicide was at that time present in Antonio Jose's mind. I want you now to put aside your arguments as regards to the preventive issues, the fencing. They do not deal with this part of the judgment. Can you present to me as succinctly as possible, what do you consider to be the factual elements which the domestic court is overlooking, which they are not giving enough weight, and which would then allow this court to call into question this finding? As succinctly as possible, just so I can clarify it in my mind. Thank you.",
        "294": "Thank you very much. I would like to ask the applicant to clarify something which is mentioned in the observations to the Grand Chamber. And this is in paragraph 57, where the applicant states that it is imperative that patients, such as her son, must have specific care with measures of containment and personal surveillance without guards or electronic bracelets. I'm curious to know, could you please explain what this means in concrete terms? So there should be no guards, there should be no electronic bracelets, but there should be containment and personal surveillance. What exactly do you mean? And following from that, if the position is, as it may seem to be, that there should have been physical obstacles preventing the patients from leaving the hospital premises, this again seems to suggest that, according to the applicant, her son should have been kept in a closed institution. And this, in turn, raises the question of consent. Now, the government is arguing that the conditions for compulsory care were not met. So could the applicant explain on what basis, then, her son could and should have been put under conditions of deprivation of liberty regardless of his consent, even if conditions of compulsory care were not met? And how do you reconcile such a position with the requirements and the case law concerning Article 5 of the Convention? Thank you.",
        "295": "Thank you, Mr. President. In the context of differential treatment on the basis of gender, so male convicts compared to female convicts, both parties address one of the possible scenarios where the violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 5 may be established. And the question for both parties will be in this context. So the government in their observations in paragraph 29 states that, I quote, such finding of a violation would call for worsening of the situation of a great mess of other people not involved in the proceedings before the court. May I kindly ask to explain how and why the situation of other people would necessarily be made worse and whether the government doesn't see a way of complying with such a possible ruling without worsening the situation of other people in line with the European Convention of Human Rights. As to the applicants, applicants in their observations in paragraphs 52, 53, refer to the individualization of punishment as the best solution and a general principle in sentencing policy that should be applied. And I would kindly ask to clarify whether the applicants mean the characteristics which are listed in Article 60 of the Russian Criminal Code, namely, which have to be taken into account when the punishment is inflicted, namely the convict's personality, influence on the rehabilitation and impact on living conditions of the convict's family, or you mean extension of the same article to female offenders or maybe both. Thank you.",
        "296": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is addressed to the government, but of course the applicants can also take a position on this question. In fact, it's a group of three different points that I would like to raise. There is scientific evidence that demonstrates that the suicide rate and the insanity rate among prisoners sentenced for life is higher than among prisoners sentenced for prison terms of fixed duration, and much higher among men than among women. Male prisoners sentenced for life tend to commit suicide or become insane more often than women sentenced for life, and much more often than people in freedom. Male offenders between 18 and 65 commit more often suicide and become more often insane than women, minors and seniors. And this occurs especially when they are serving life or indeterminate prison terms. My question to the government, do you have any statistical data in Russia to contradict this evidence? Second question, is there any scientific evidence in Russia of a correlation between the sex and age of the offender and the gravity of the offense? Can you prove to this court that men, and particularly men aged between 18 and 65, commit more serious crimes than women offenders or male offenders under 18 or male offenders over 65? Final question, is there any scientific evidence, statistical evidence in Russia of a correlation between life imprisonment and lower crime rates, or at least lower violent crime rates? Can you prove to this court that this Russian life imprisonment sentencing policy has produced lower crime rates and particularly lower violent crime rates? Can you prove to this court that the prohibition of life sentence to female, juvenile and senior offenders has caused lower crime rates among the Russian female, juvenile and senior population? Thank you very much.",
        "297": "Just a brief question to the government. The government states in its observation that the Russian criminal code provides for only 19 types of crimes punishable by life imprisonment. And then the government states that life imprisonment is not imposed in a person automatically for the commission of the above crimes. I think I understand it means that there is the life imprisonment is not mandatory. It's not mandatory in any of these 19 cases. I would like the government to confirm this statement if really this is the case. I think it's an important point. Thank you.",
        "298": "Thank you. I would like to ask the applicants to clarify to the court what kind of measures the authorities would have to implement to restore the rights of the applicants, I would say to avoid discrimination in case we find a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 5 of the convention. Thank you.",
        "299": "Just a short question. We have heard that the conditions for life prisoners are much worse than for others. And I just would like to understand better why is it not only the time that is different, but also the conditions? Because that means that for women, you have basically always different conditions. Thank you.",
        "300": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser 2 questions au parti. L'une pour le gouvernement, l'autre pour les requ\u00e9rants. Pour le gouvernement, tout d'abord. Le requ\u00e9rant pr\u00e9tend que les frais d'\u00e9pargne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s par les juridictions comp\u00e9tentes sur la base de la valeur modifi\u00e9e de l'objet de mitiges, c'est-\u00e0-dire 105 000 kounas. Et il d\u00e9c\u00e8de l\u00e0 une certaine contradiction entre le fait de calculer ces d\u00e9penses sur la base de la valeur modifi\u00e9e, d'une part, et d'autre part, de rejeter cette m\u00eame modification. Je voudrais avoir votre r\u00e9action sur cet argument. Pour le requ\u00e9rant, le gouvernement pr\u00e9tend, contrairement \u00e0 ce que vous venez de dire, que l'avocat de Montenegro qui avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de la requ\u00e9rante avait bien le droit de le faire et que le code de proc\u00e9dure civile de Montenegro et de la Croatie avait essentiellement le m\u00eame contenu et que, par cons\u00e9quent, l'avocat du pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de la requ\u00e9rante connaissait bien les cons\u00e9quences de son choix de pr\u00e9ciser l'objet de litige \u00e0 une valeur de 10 000 kounas. J'aimerais votre commentaire sur cette pr\u00e9tention de gouvernement. Merci beaucoup.",
        "301": "I have a question to the government. It's a point raised by the applicant, which I believe the government has not addressed, at least until now. It's about the clarity of the legal framework in Croatia on the admissibility criteria for an appeal before the Supreme Court. The point made by the applicant is that the situation is not entirely clear. There is some contradiction between the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court. There are contradictory positions on this precise topic. I would like the government to elaborate on this argument, on this alleged contradiction between Supreme Court case law and the Constitutional Court case law. Thank you.",
        "302": "Just one question that caught my eye while the government was presenting, stating that actually the applicants only asked for the power of attorney to be given to the court and did not challenge the power of attorney. And I will read from the Croatian file how it is stated. The power of attorney in the file is given two submissions. The first one, which asks for the power of attorney to be challenged, states that Vukasin Zubac allegedly gave his opponent Kosi Zubac for the termination of the contract for the replacement of the property. And after that, it continues to ask for it to be put in the file. I would like to know if the government can comment on this.",
        "303": "Thank you, President. I would have two questions to the Russian government. First, I would like to understand the decision-making process when the riot police intervenes and disperses demonstrations. I guess there is some general strategy how to act. Who elaborates this strategy? On which level is it done? And then, when the police officers of the OMON, of the riot police, intervene, do they do it spontaneously? Do they ask the headquarter who takes the respective orders? That would be my first question. And my second question is for interpretation of Russian law. I understand that in every modern society it's sometimes necessary to queue up somewhere before an entrance of a theater or shop, wherever. It was a court building, you queue up. And how do you then differentiate between queuing up \u2013 there might be many people \u2013 and between what you consider an assembly? Thank you.",
        "304": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have one question that I would like to pose to the applicant. As you're aware, one of the questions posed for the hearing and one of the issues the Grand Chamber is considering is the issue under Article 18. We have now a recent Grand Chamber judgment in a case called Metabishvili versus Georgia, where the court consolidates its case law on this issue. And one of the issues mentioned here today is the finding by the court that under Article 18, the so-called predominant purpose has to be or appeared to be the fundamental aspect of the case. So it is on that basis. And because there is an argument made by the government which hasn't been addressed here today or in your written pleadings, the government says in their observations, and I refer here to the observations of the 18th of December lodged with the court, in paragraph 13, the government says, in particular, Article 18 of the convention was expressly invoked by the applicant in only two out of his five applications. And those two applications relate to the first two episodes. Article 18 was not expressed, according to the government, was not expressly invoked by the applicant for the five last episodes. And the reference to political reasons or persecutions is not to be found in the initial application. Mr. Navalnyy said here today Article 18 is the key issue in the case. Could I then ask the applicant to elaborate, why is in Article 18, why didn't it form part of the initial pleadings by the applicant and an argumentation made already at the state of original applications within the court? And how would you answer the government's contention on this issue? Because, after all, that's one of the elements that we need to consider. Thank you.",
        "305": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question au gouvernement. Est-ce qu'en Russie, d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je me permets d'insister sur la notion de g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 et non sur le cas individuel dont la Cor\u00e9e saisit, les autorit\u00e9s font preuve de s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tous les manifestants d\u00e8s lors qu'elles consid\u00e8rent qu'une manifestation est ill\u00e9gale? Merci.",
        "306": "Thank you M. president. I have three blocks of questions. The first addresses the question of admissibility. The first two elements of that go to the applicant. The government in paragraphs 11 to 15 of its observation to the Grand Chamber raises an objection of admissibility of the Article 5 complaint in relation to six out of the seven arrests complained of. How does the applicant respond to that objection, which might of course go to the court's jurisdiction to consider these complaints, and how, if at all, do you say the court should deal with that objection now? The same question arises in relation to Article 11, where the government in paragraphs 32 and 33 of its observation also expressly asserts, and they did again so today, that the applicant denied participating in a public assembly and did not raise the substance of the Article 11 complaint in the domestic courts. There is, of course, then for the government the procedurally prior question, what you say is the adequate and effective remedy you say the applicant should have exhausted, and what evidence is there that confirms its adequacy and effectiveness. The second block of question goes to Article 11 and deals with, again, the first element of it is addressed to the applicant. The government's assertion, both in writing and today, that the applicant denied participating in a public assembly leads me to the question to ask, on what basis do you say, especially in relation to the solo picket on 27 October 2012 and the arrest while waiting outside the courthouse on 24 February 2014, that Article 11 was in fact engaged at all? After all, as this court held in Tata and Farber v. Hungary, the term assembly under Article 11 has an autonomous meaning, I pause here to query whether waiting outside a court building is even an expression, and that fits into Judge Nussberg's question, occurs in the public space, does not necessarily turn such event into an assembly. Now that, of course, then leads me to the follow-up question for the government. In that same case, this court reasoned that such an autonomous meaning serves the interests of the protection of the right against improper classification in national law. The example the court gives in that case may well be pertinent to the present case. It is this. By relying on the domestic law on assemblies and by implication of the court's case law in the context of Article 11, which accepts in principle that the imposition of prior notification may be justified, the authorities in that case were said to seek to create a prior restraint on the freedom of expression, which is incompatible with the free communication of ideas and might undermine freedom of expression. The question for the government is this. Would you accept that reliance on the law of assemblies to justify the applicant's arrest, at least in relation to the two incidents identified, amount or might amount to an improper classification by the domestic authorities and or the courts, and or is capable of providing evidence relevant to the assessment of the applicant's complaint of bad faith or ulterior motives, which is currently pleaded under Article 18? And finally, in relation to that complaint about bad faith and ulterior motive, of course, the government in its further observations in paragraph 28 relies on Article 17, abuse of rights in relation to an aspect of the applicant's claim. The question I have is the case on bad faith and ulterior motives is, of course, currently pleaded and responded to under Article 18 of the Convention, limitation on the use of rights, on the restriction on rights. Questions of both parties is this. Is there any reason why the court should be limited to considering this complaint solely by reference to Article 18 and why it could not also be classified as an abuse of rights under Article 17, an article which I said you raise, the government raises in relation to the applicant's complaint? After all, in so far as relevant, that article provides that nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any state any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth therein or, perhaps importantly in this case, at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention. Thank you very much. Thank you.",
        "307": "Thank you Mr. President. My question goes to the applicant. The agent of the government just presented some statistical data concerning the rallies organized by the applicant or by your movement saying that many of them have been authorized, regularly authorized. Do you contest or confirm such affirmation? Thank you very much.",
        "308": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question qui est dirig\u00e9e aux deux parties. La question est la suivante. Comment s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e, dans le d\u00e9tail, l'ex\u00e9cution de la mesure d'urgence du 17 octobre 2008 par laquelle X fut confi\u00e9 \u00e0 une famille d'accueil? Je vous remercie.",
        "309": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. This case is centered by the parties very much around what is the role of this court in cases of this nature. And Mr. Sajistad, you said three things during your pleadings which prompt my question. The first is you said we need to assess the situation at the point in time when the decision in question, the forced adoption decision was taken in 2012. You accepted that the court must apply strict scrutiny and therefore assess whether there were relevant and sufficient reasons. I want to proceed on the basis that that is something the court will agree with you with. That remains to be seen. But my question is on that basis. In this case, we have a court judgment, the city court judgment of February 2012, where the applicant presents a claim that the situation at that point in time had changed. She was married. She had another child. And I want your view on how we and I should understand the city court's judgment in relation to that claim made by the applicant at that point. The city court's judgment, this is page 11 of the judgment, the court says the court agrees with the county social welfare board that the mother has not changed in such a way as to indicate it is now highly probable that she will be able to provide X with proper care. The court endorses the county social welfare board's grounds. In the court's view, the mother's clear limitations as a caregiver cannot be mitigated by an adapted transitional scheme, assistance measures, or support from the mother's network. Then the court says, and here is what I would like your input on, and I would also ask Mr. Diodone if he has a view. The court will not discuss the other arguments regarding the mother's ability to provide care in more detail as returning X is in any case not an option due to the serious problems it would cause X to be moved from the foster home. So my question is, Mr. Syestad, should I read the city court's judgment as taking a clear position on the applicant's central claim as regards the situation in 2012 that her situation as regards marriage and her caregiving of another child was not examined as such, at least in the reasoning there is no reference to that? Or is there another way to read the judgment? I also draw attention to your observations, paragraph 165, where the government makes its own assessment where it says, it would not have been correct to set the assessments with regard to exercise with reference to vague descriptions of the first applicant's care for her daughter. May I ask, why were they vague? Was there a lack of information at that point in the file which would clarify the nature of that role and in the global assessment by the Drammenkurt? So just a clarification on how I should read the Drammenkurt's judgment on that. Just a second question, which is the issue in relation to the legal test we're applying. The government refers to the two-limb child best interest test. Now as you said, and my question is prompted by another part of your pleading, you said, the test presumes first that the child should remain with the biological family unless the parent is considered particularly unfit. Then we would go to the second limb of the test, which is the stability of the environment. May I ask this question? If this court were to consider that the fitness assessment, the first limb, might be called into question because of lack of relevant and sufficient reasons, would you still consider that under the second limb there would be an adequate justification for the measure in question? In other words, if the first limb of the child best interest test under the court's case law is not met, is there a violation already there? Or would you defend the claim further and say, even though it is not clear that she was particularly unfit, in any event, your argument would be there would be no violation under the second limb. Could you clarify the relationship between the two? And I would also ask Mr. Diudonne to comment, if he so wishes. Thank you.",
        "310": "Thank you, Mr. President. I will have a very small factual question. It's perhaps difficult for the representative of the government. The question is addressed to the government to answer, but I will nevertheless try. Why didn't the assistant midwife who made an assessment at the moment when the applicant left the hospital, when the child was three weeks old, why didn't she appear in further procedures whereas others did? She disappeared after having given her assessment when the child was three weeks old, and others appeared further on, but she didn't. Is there a reason for that? Thank you very much.",
        "311": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have one question to the government and one to the applicant, which are prompted by the pleadings this morning. To the government, I noticed from the observations of the government that on the Article 6 complaint and the merits of the Article 6 complaint dealing with the independence and impartiality of the organs deciding the case at domestic level, we have renditions of reasoning in paragraph 62 to 65, which do not make any reference to a case called Alexander Volkov versus Ukraine. May I ask the government to comment on whether it considers the merits issue under Article 6 to be distinguishable in this case from the case of Alexander Volkov, and then explain, if so, to what extent? So our assessment can be based on that argumentation by the government. To the applicant, I have one question as well. There are basically two core arguments presented by the applicant why there has been an interference with Article 8, why Article 8 is applicable in this case. The first is in paragraph 99 of your observations, which are basically issues going to the damage to the applicant's reputation. And in paragraph 100, there is a reference to financial consequences. I want to turn to the first, the damage to the applicant's reputation. May I ask, because it is not addressed in your written observations, it was not addressed here orally, the court has held that Article 8 cannot be relied upon to complain of a loss of reputation, which is the foreseeable consequence of one's own actions. This has primarily been directed to criminal offenses, but it is not only limited to criminal offenses. May I ask the applicant to comment, why should not the court apply that doctrine on the facts of a case which deals with the underperformance of a civil servant, and thus dismissal being the consequence of that underperformance? Is it the view of the applicant that this part of the court's case law is simply inapplicable in a situation like this, thus being the basis upon which we could not rely upon potential damage to the applicant's reputation? I just want to ask you this, and I want you to put aside, for the sake of argument, the case of Ermeni versus Hungary. Let's assume that Ermeni versus Hungary has not been decided by this court. So don't rely on that case in your answer, but give me your own principled answer to the question. Thank you.",
        "312": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser ma question en fran\u00e7ais, si possible. Merci beaucoup. Ma question s'adresse au requ\u00e9rant et elle se situe dans le prolongement de la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e tout \u00e0 l'heure par mon coll\u00e8gue, le pr\u00e9sident Spano. Elle concerne notamment le paragraphe 100 de vos observations. L\u00e0, il y a une allusion, mais une allusion seulement \u00e0 des choses que vous avez \u00e9voqu\u00e9es aujourd'hui. Vous dites, les vraies raisons de ma r\u00e9vocation n'\u00e9taient pas connues que d'un petit nombre de personnes. Les vraies raisons. Mais ces vraies raisons n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9es ou en tout cas pas clairement dans vos observations. Et aujourd'hui, on a entendu une d\u00e9monstration qui \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, entre autres, sur l'article 18 de la Convention, une disposition qui, jusqu'\u00e0 maintenant, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9voqu\u00e9e. Et on a cru comprendre que votre argumentation tourne essentiellement autour de l'id\u00e9e suivant laquelle le requ\u00e9rant a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 de ses fonctions dans le contexte d'une certaine pers\u00e9cution politique. Il y a l\u00e0 un d\u00e9calage assez \u00e9vident, me semble-t-il, entre les observations \u00e9crites et vos observations orales de tout \u00e0 l'heure. Et on aimerait peut-\u00eatre avoir un peu plus d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments sur ce point. Merci beaucoup.",
        "313": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My question concerns the applicant and his complaint under Article 8. You mentioned today in your oral pleading for the first time, it was not included in your observation, a letter which was written on the 2nd February 2010 by Mr. Bondik addressed to every judge in Ukraine and which contained accusations against the applicant. Now could you please explain us what exactly was the correlation between this letter from 2010, then the applicant's dismissal from 2011, and his private life under Article 8? Thank you.",
        "314": "Thank you very much, President. Well, I would have a question to the government first. In your memorial, you wrote on page eight, I quote, only if the claimants had denounced the breach of data legislation committed by the company could the Data Protection Agency have studied and protected their rights. Now in your pleadings, you have explained that they could have had access to the data as collected, they could have asked for erasure, and you also said that there could have been a heavy fine against the enterprise. I would like to know if there's jurisprudence that enterprises have been fined for similar violations of data protection law, and more importantly, could the applicant themselves have claimed damages under the data protection law or under civil law? I don't know. And in this context, a question to the applicants. When the applicants learned about the existence of the recordings and the breach of the data protection law, why didn't you appeal to the Data Protection Agency? And my last question, also more to the government, why did the employer not inform? I understand that there was a workers council in this enterprise. And so I want to know why the employer did not inform the workers council before installing the video surveillance. Why didn't they inform at least them, if not the worker themselves? Thank you.",
        "315": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have some questions for the two parties about facts. I start by the applicants, but when the first question, it can be answered also for the government if they know. I would like to know the number of employees in this supermarket of Mercadona at the time when the facts occurred, the number of employees, and the exact number of cashiers, if you have this data. Well, a second question for the applicants. In your observations, you say, and now also in the pleadings, that the company Mercadona filed a criminal complaint against the applicants, although they have been prescribed. But my question here is, I would like to know, to be sure, if the company filed this criminal complaint against how many people, according to our data that you have done it, given to us, they say about 14 persons. I want to have this clear. And a third question, if the applicants were informed about the installation of cameras, at least into the areas of clients. And moreover, we have also the data that they were in the labor courts. I want to know if the facts were proved or not in the labor courts. And in the criminal process, if the minor offense of robbery or theft, although it was prescribed, if it was proved. Thank you. And later, well, the last for the applicants. The fact that the applicants signed an agreement of dismissal with the employer, has it implied them to go later to the labor courts? Also, have they testified personally before labor courts? And now, the questions for the government. The first one is the same. The second, according to the jurors' observations, and also here in the hearing, you explained that the Spanish national law in Article V about personal data protection prescribes the obligation to inform workers about the installation of video surveillance. Then the question is, if this legislation is so clear, how could you explain that the domestic national courts involved in the case, they have taken as legal proof this video surveillance that was secret? Was it considered as a legal evidence? And why they apply the labor regulation, Article Number 20.3, and not so clear the law about personal data protection? Third, were the applicants given the opportunity to challenge the authenticity or veracity of the evidence and to oppose to its issue? And last one, last one for the government. I have here a draft for the organic law about data protection that they are now discussing in Parliament in Spain. And in the Article 89, they say that the workers, they have to be informed about the installation of cameras. But also, I read that it is accepted as proof. It's a draft, but I want to know. It is accepted as proof in the event of a flagrant commission of an illegal act. It can be accepted as proof if the workers, if there is a label or a ticket in the shop. I want to know this future legislation. Thank you very much.",
        "316": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have two questions. They are addressed to the applicant, but of course the government is most welcome also to respond. The first question concerns Article 6, and more specifically the settlement agreement signed by the applicant when dismissed. And the applicants are arguing that the use of it violates Article 6. But I want to understand the complaint. Is the applicant arguing that this settlement agreement should never have been permitted as evidence because it was obtained under duress? Or is the applicant arguing that because of this settlement agreement, there was no access to a court because the court could not assess the merits? So these are two totally different complaints, whether it is unfair because of them unlawful obtained evidence, or whether it somehow restricted the applicants in having access to a court. That I would like to understand. I do not understand it from the written observations. My second question concerns Article 8 and goes in the same lines as Angelika Nu\u00dfberger, which addresses to the government, but I address it now to the applicants. The applicants are arguing that the covered video surveillance and recordings without prior notification violated the applicant's right to respect for private life. And let's just assume for the sake of argument that the government or the Grand Chamber agrees. Let's assume that the court says that there is a violation of Article 8, they should have been notified in advance. My question to the applicants is then, does it automatically flow from that that the use of the video also violates the convention and the dismissal as such is unlawful? In other words, can there be a violation of Article 8 because of the lack of prior notification without necessarily resulting in the evidence not being permitted? In other words, could the domestic courts have redressed the violation, if any, by other means? And that is part of the same that Angelika Nu\u00dfberger asked. So I would like to have your view on that. Were, then, your view the only way to redress this was to exclude the evidence and find the dismissal unlawful, or whether there would have been other ways of redressing such a violation? Thank you.",
        "317": "My question goes also to the applicants, and it is along the same lines, but in a bit of a different context to the one just posed by Judge Kj\u00f8lbro. I would ask the government to correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand the pleadings of the government and their understanding of the national courts case law, or judgments in this case, in particular, the tribunals, the Superior Court of Justice of Catalonia of 28 January, 2011, to suggest that indeed you accept that the employer here violated domestic data protection laws by not notifying in an adequate manner under domestic law. Okay. My question then to the applicant is so I understand your argument. The government says the violation of the data protection law cannot lead per se as such, only due to the prior notification to a violation of Article 8. Do you, is that your argument? Are you arguing in this case that there is an absolute symmetry between the violation of the data protection law and the violation of Article 8? I'm not asking about how the labor courts could have remedied. Judge Kj\u00f8lbro asked that. I'm asking about the extent of your argument. If your argument is not that it is a direct violation, the two are the same, to what extent, what other elements in your view should come into play? Thank you very much.",
        "318": "Yeah, just two brief questions, mainly to the government concerning the status of civil servants in Hungary. The first one, do the professional civil servants are recruited, hired freely by the government or by the authorities, or they must pass some kind of a competitive process of selections by means of examinations or other ways of appraising the merit and value? And the second question refers to this missile. Do the professional civil servants have tenure? That is to say, they have the expectation of employment stability for their active life unless there are specific reasons for this missile, or they are considering this missile in the same circumstances as the employees in the private sector applying the general labor law. These are my two questions. Thank you.",
        "319": "Thank you very much. I would like to ask the following two questions. I understand that these questions are addressed to both parties. I understand that the applicant was eligible for early retirement because he had, at the age of 47, completed 30 years of service. If this was the case, was the same regime of early retirement also applicable to employees in the private sector? Or was this only applicable to those who worked in the public sector? Or was it perhaps so that certain categories of employees in the private sector only were entitled to the same kind of early retirement on the basis of completion of 30 years of service? The second question I would like to ask is the following. For the applicant, the disbursements of his pension payments were suspended on the 1st of July 2013 and onwards because of the employment status that he had at that point in time. What would have happened if he had subsequently moved to be employed in the private sector? Would the pension payments have been resumed if he had began to work in the private sector instead after the 1st of July 2013? Thank you.",
        "320": "Thank you. Just one simple question. If the applicant, as an early retired person, pays additional contribution to the pension fund during his work in civil service, will he at the end receive a higher pension due to that additional contribution to the pension fund? Thank you.",
        "321": "Thank you very much. My questions complement those of Judge Koskelo and Judge Vehabovi\u0107. The government has informed us that the applicant was the beneficiary of an early retirement scheme. But as such, was he entitled to retire at the age of 47, or was he obliged to do so? And if he wasn't obliged to do so, does that mean that he could have continued to work until the statutory retirement age, which I understand was approximately 62 years and six months? The next question relates to the question asked by Judge Vehabovi\u0107. I'd like you to clarify, I understood the respondent government's submissions as being that neither the applicant as an employee nor his public sector employer made any additional contributions which led to this entitlement to an early retirement pension. If, in response to Judge Koskelo's question, it transpired that private sector employees could also benefit from early retirement, I'd like you to clarify whether a private sector employee or a private sector employer would have to make additional contributions in order to cover the longer disbursement of the pension. My third question is purely factual, but as some people have already indicated, there are some factual omissions in the file. The applicant retired from his first public sector job in the year 2000, and then we're informed that he began working again in the public sector in 2012, if I'm not mistaken. Did he work between 2000 and 2012? And if so, in which sector? And finally, my fourth question is a more general one. In its decision in a case called E.B. against Hungary, decided in 2013, this court has already examined the two mandatory pillars of the Hungarian pension system, which were established in 1998 with the second pillar abolished in 2010. My question is, does this reform of the pension system and the change in its structure and organization have any relevance in the present case? Thank you.",
        "322": "My question is with respect to both parties, and it is a follow-up on questions that have already been asked. And it is, could you clarify the type of contributions given to the pensions fund by the applicant and his employer prior to 2000, when he became eligible to early retirement, and compare them to someone situated in a similar position in the private sector? Thank you.",
        "323": "I would just like to follow up to the question by Judge Koskelo when she asked what would happen if he would move from the public sector to the private sector. And for me it's interesting also what would happen with the person who worked prior to the private sector and then started to work in the private sector after this early retirement and then would move to the public sector. Would the person then lose the pension?",
        "324": "Thank you. I have a question to the government. So I'd like to know if there is a policy in Hungary in order to assure a fair balance between generations in the public as well as in the private sector, in particular with the aim to promote better access to employment by means of a better distribution of work between the generations, and to regulate the labor market, in particular for the purposes of Urban unemployment. Thank you.",
        "325": "Thank you, Mr. President. In order to have very clear information on a matter that was already asked twice, could the applicant inform us what was the basis, the legal basis of early retirement, because there are so many, or there were so many under Hungarian law? Second, do I understand correctly the government that there are possibilities to be employed in the public sector on part-time basis, even if someone is pensioner, and to keep the pension benefits at the same time? As well as, is it possible to have a legal relationship in the public sector under other forms of, under other laws, namely under the civil code, under mandate, or undertaking? And I ask this because the applicant claimed that there is a number of employees whose status is not explained, who receive pension benefit and are employed. And we don't know the reason, other than for the health sector, why, what is the legal basis of they being in the public sector, although they are in pension? And finally, do I understand correctly that between 2007 and the 2013 June change, the applicant did contribute to the pension fund, or was his salary exempt of pension contribution in that period? Thank you.",
        "326": "Do we understand correctly what you said, that in case the person goes to the private sector, his pension will be suspended? Is his pension suspended in case he works in the private sector? You said it is suspended in case he returns to the private sector. Is this the case? Yes.",
        "327": "Thank you. I have a question to the applicants. For what kind of activities and or services the applicant has requested compensation from the Hungarian Calvinist Church in front of state courts? And the second question, whether those activities were at least partially governed by the state law? If so, please give a relevant example or examples. Thank you.",
        "328": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma 1re question s'adresse au requ\u00e9rant du gouvernement et concerne la question de l'\u00e9puisement des voies de recours internes par rapport \u00e0 la 1re requ\u00eate qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite par le requ\u00e9rant en 2007. Et il semble que le r\u00e9current soutient qu'il avait \u00e9puis\u00e9 les voies de recours internes parce qu'une requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame n'\u00e9tait pas possible \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 sous la l\u00e9gislation hongroise de l'\u00e9poque. Et le gouvernement semble avoir une autre opinion sur cette question. Ma 2e question concerne le probl\u00e8me de contr\u00f4le de consonnalit\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour consonnelle de 2003, statut sur certains principes concernant la relation entre le droit eccl\u00e9siastique et le droit de l'Etat. Il semble qu'il n'y a pas une unit\u00e9 d'interpr\u00e9tation de cette d\u00e9cision de 2003. Et je voulais vous demander d'abord quel est le statut juridique de ces d\u00e9cisions dans l'ordre juridique hongrois. Et deuxi\u00e8mement, quelle est la pratique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie par les Etats et par les organes eccl\u00e9siastiques suivant cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour consonnelle de 2003? Finalement, ma derni\u00e8re question s'adresse au probl\u00e8me des tribunaux eccl\u00e9siastiques. Je voulais vous demander... \u00c7a, c'est une question qui est adress\u00e9e au gouvernement. Si ces tribunaux eccl\u00e9siastiques ne sont pas tenus par les lois hongroises, comme vous avez dit, je suppose qu'ils sont tenus par la Constitution. Comment est-ce qu'on peut adresser des questions qui tiennent \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 des jugements de ces tribunaux par rapport \u00e0 la Constitution de l'Etat hongrois? Je vous remercie, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "329": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have several questions. The first one is addressed to the applicant, and I would like to clarify one point in the submissions in the applicant. Does the applicant say that he has a right recognized under domestic law, or is the position of the applicant that he just has an arguable claim but no right recognized under domestic law? Is this about a right or is this about an arguable claim? Then the second question. The second question is also addressed at the applicant, and it concerns remuneration for teaching religion. Is the claim of the applicant based on the same contract? Has there been a contract for the allowance, the service allowance, or has there been a separate contract? Is the claim concerning remuneration for teaching religion based on the same legal basis? Is there a separate legal basis, and if so, what's this legal basis for this claim? And then the third question, it also concerns, it is also addressed at the applicant. The government says that the claim concerning remuneration for teaching religion was raised too late, and that it was rejected on formal grounds, yet it was possible to raise the same claim again before Hungarian courts. Does the applicant agree with the statement of the government, or does the applicant want to defend another point of view on this specific issue? Thank you.",
        "330": "Thank you, President. I would have three questions to the applicants. The first question, you referred to a case where the ecclesiastical court decided not to adjudicate the case, but to refer it to the labor court. I would like to know on what basis, or why did it refer it to the labor court? Was it because they said it's based on state law and not on ecclesiastical relationship in this specific case? And what did the labor court then do? Second question, let's argue that the ecclesiastical court system is not compatible with Article 6 of the Convention, because there's a discretion, there might be a problem of independence, et cetera. So if the applicant had gone to the ecclesiastical courts, and then there would have been a problem, let's say they would argue that the final outcome was arbitrary, could they have brought it in some way to the constitutional court or to a state court to claim that the system has not functioned in a compatible with rule of law? And the third question, let's assume the court finds a violation. Let's assume the procedure is reopened. Let's assume in the reopened procedure, the civil court changed their jurisprudence and accept a claim. What would be the final outcome? Because I understand it could never be enforced against the church. So if the church refuses to pay in the end, it would remain a theoretical claim, if I understand correctly. I would like to have some clarification. And perhaps one last question to the government. The government has argued that the applicant has not argued damages under tort law, and he could have done so. And that was a problem in your view of exhaustion of domestic remedies. But would you say he would have an arguable claim concerning damages under tort law? Thank you very much.",
        "331": "Thank you. It seems to me that there is some contestation regarding the teaching of history of religion. The government referred to the position of the Supreme Court that this claim has not been raised in the domestic proceedings. And therefore, it was belated at that stage. Now, I would like to have the views of the parties in regard of the documents submitted to the court, namely the preparatory claim to the court of first instance, then all the appeals made by the applicant, where, for example, on page 2 of the original preparatory document, it expressly claims that they did pay for one week the amount for teaching of religion, but they didn't pay for the rest. So it seems to me that in the documents, there is reference to this. And I would like to hear the views of the parties, whether this claim has been made or not. I really don't understand at this stage. Given the submitted documents. Now, assuming for the sake of argument that this claim has been properly made, as already indicated by Judge Gri\u0163co, this resulted in teaching in a school. Is there an applicable state law which governs the legal position of someone in the position of the applicant in public education? I assume that this school was part of the public education system, or some kind of public law applied to this. This is also a question I would like to be answered. Was the school, the foundation school, was that under the jurisdiction of the state? If so, what were the applicable laws? I ask this because in the case referred to several times, namely the decision of the Constitutional Court in 2003, was related to a professor of theology, right? If I understand correctly, this is a question to the government. And in that case, at the end of the day, the law of higher education was found applicable to that professor of theology at a denominational university. Maybe I completely misunderstand. This is a very complicated situation. So I just would like to have clarification on the second legal issue. What was the situation in the case of the Constitutional Court case? Now again, this is primarily to the government. Assuming for the sake of the argument that the case is admissible, so there is an issue of access to a court. Of course, this is governed by Golder. Golder is not an absolute rule. It knows implicit exceptions. What could be? The government refused to enter into the merit, I understand perfectly well. But assuming that it is admissible, what could be, in the view of the government, a ground to apply the implicit exceptions under Golder? Is there any specific ground not to allow access to a court, which is, in principle, possible, once again, under Golder? And the very last question I would like to clarify. The government said that the service contract was, or sorry, not contract. That's exactly the issue. The service relationship or service contract under exclusively ecclesiastical law, probably a better approach to this, was terminated at the time when the applicant asked for the 50%. And my understanding is that he was suspended, and the relationship at that point in time has not been terminated, because that occurred later at the end of the disciplinary proceedings. So if you could clarify whether this was an ongoing relationship until the end of the final disciplinary decision, or it was already terminated at the moment when the disciplinary proceedings started. Thank you very much.",
        "332": "Thank you, Madam President. I have several questions that I would like to pose to the government and then one question to the applicant. And I would like the government to bear with me. I want to ask some question in relation to documents in the case and also in relation to the legal issues we are confronted with. As the government would appreciate, there are three main questions before the court in this case in light of our case law. The first question is, was a CIA detention center operating in Lithuania at the time in question? If so, was the applicant in this case detained there during that period? And if both of those questions are answered in the affirmative, can it be said and established that his detention and treatment in Lithuania can be attributed for convention purposes to the Lithuanian authorities? I want, as regards the first question, the allegation that a detention center was operational in Lithuania, may I ask the government to clarify three documents which have been submitted by the government in this case? The first one is document number 16. It is a declassified document. In this document, which is a resolution of 25 July 2002, there is a text which I would like clarification on. It states that the resolution in it initiates a file in case, and then there is a redacted part, necessity to find and arrange premises, redaction, for the purposes of extradition, bracket, transfer, of working secret intelligence collaborators, also to ensure their protection and living conditions. May I ask confirmation that the word extradition, this is a translation presented by the government, is the word extradition a literal translation of the Lithuanian term? And if that is the case, in what context can the word extradition be used as regard working secret intelligence collaborators? Please clarify that issue for the court if possible. I would also mention document number 17, which again talks about the extradition of secret intelligence collaborators. Please clarify if possible the use of the word extradition here in this context. I turn to document number 30, which is a part of the documents submitted by the government. This is a record of inspections of the premises in Antavilu of 4 June 2010. Could the government please explain why no pictures are presented to the court from inside this building in contrast with the inspection of another premises submitted to the court? In other words, there are only pictures of outside the perimeter. Please explain why no pictures are inside the building in question. My second question goes to the second issue before the court. That is the question of whether the applicant has made out and the government has, if the applicant has made a prima facie case to the effect that it was in Lithuania, whether the government has demonstrated with sufficient explanations or disproved that allegation. The reason I ask here, I want to turn to paragraph 414 of the judgment in Al Nashiri versus Poland, where the court notes that the Polish government have offered no explanation for the nature of, the reasons for, or the purposes of the landing of a certain plane on their territory of 5 December 2002, a plane which in all the relevant, reliable, and thorough international inquiries was conclusively identified as a rendition aircraft. The reason I ask this question is twofold. Firstly, the Simas inquiry stated clearly that Boeing 737 N787WH, which landed on 18 February 2005, and I quote from the conclusion states, according to data submitted by the SBGS, five passengers arrived in that aircraft, none of whom was mentioned by the former Deputy Director General of the SSD, Dainius Daba\u0161inskas, in the explanations he gave to the committee at the meeting. According to customs data, no thorough customs inspection of the aircraft was carried out, and no cargo was unloaded from it or onto it. In the same Simas conclusion, it is stated that Deputy Director General Daba\u0161inskas, with the knowledge of Director General Arvydas Pocius, provided the US officers with opportunities to have unrestricted access to the aircraft on at least two occasions. In addition, at least on one occasion, the opportunities for inspections of the aircraft by the officers was deliberately restricted. My last issue here is a document presented to the court in relation to this. And this is a document which deals with a letter of the Customs Department. This is document number nine submitted by the government. There it states, the aircraft Boeing 737, tail number N787W, that landed in Palanga Airport on 18 February 2005, was not recorded in the aircraft arrivals registration journal at the Palanga Airport post of the Klaipeda territorial customs. This is the plane alleged by the applicant to have been the plane he, in all likelihood, was rendered on. My question now to the government, can the government at this point in time, in light of the methodology in Al Nusheira versus Poland, provide an explanation for the nature of, the purpose of, the landing of this aircraft, and the reasons for the lack of examination of the aircraft in question? My last substantive question on this issue goes to the last of the three questions, which deals with the attribution issue, the responsibility of the state, the knowledge and complicity of the state. The counsel for the government stated that no knowledge of the actual rendition program was in existence at the point in time. There is no evidence to suggest knowledge of Lithuanian authorities as to the nature of the program. May I draw the government's attention to paragraph 441 of Al Nusheira versus Poland, where this chronological situation is taken into account in the following terms, that already in January 2002 and August 2003, that is well before the allegations of detention of the applicant in this case took place, numerous public sources were consistently reporting ill treatment and abuse to which captured terrorists suspects were subjected. There was a 2003 PACE resolution adopted, which also deals with and expresses concern on this issue that persons were being detained in European countries on this basis. So may I ask, how would the Lithuanian government invite the court to differentiate the situation, assuming that the court were to find that a detention center indeed was in existence and that the applicant was indeed detained on Lithuanian soil, how would the government invite the court to differentiate its argument as regards knowledge and complicity to the judicial facts found in Al Nusheira versus Poland? My last question to the government deals with the effectiveness of the two inquiries, the parliamentary Simas inquiry and the criminal investigation. May I ask the government to clarify whether it considers that the Simas inquiry in and of itself was effective for the purposes of Article III as regards independence, thoroughness, promptness, and so forth. May I also ask, finally, for the government to clarify the status of the applicant. It is clear that there has been, is there any possibility for the applicant to be allocated victim status within the domestic proceedings? Does he have any possibility at all to be a participant in the pre-trial investigation ongoing? My last point there as regards to promptness, in the reopening decision of 22nd January 2015 in operative point number two in the prosecutor general's decision to reopen the pre-trial investigation, it is stated that the set deadline is three months from the reopening of the pre-trial investigation. Please explain why it is that you still, the investigation is still pending. Thank you.",
        "333": "Merci, Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente. Suite aux questions de mon coll\u00e8gue Spano, je voudrais poser encore deux questions tr\u00e8s concr\u00e8tes au gouvernement, et tout particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 M. le Vice-ministre. Si je vous ai bien compris, \u00e0 travers l'interpr\u00e9tation en fran\u00e7ais, M. le Vice-ministre, vous avez dit que le vol du 18 f\u00e9vrier 2005, N787WH, et celui du 25 mars 2006, N733MA, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour transporter un chargement sp\u00e9cial. Un chargement sp\u00e9cial. Ma question est simple. Est-ce que vous pouvez nous fournir quelques... renseignements sur la nature de ce chargement? Si je comprends bien, vous acceptez qu'il s'agissait donc des vols qui ont effectivement atterri sur le territoire ou qui sont partis de votre territoire, du territoire lituanien, qu'apparemment ce sont des vols de la CIA, et c'est la nature donc du chargement qui me pr\u00e9occupe un peu. Et deuxi\u00e8me question, si je vous ai bien compris, M. le Vice-ministre, vous avez dit que les locaux identifi\u00e9s par le projet 1 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles, et que les locaux identifi\u00e9s dans le contexte du projet 2 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour des activit\u00e9s de renseignement. Donc, si je vous comprends bien, ces locaux-l\u00e0 existaient, ils \u00e9taient bien et bien utilis\u00e9s par la CIA, mais on ne sait pas exactement pour quel genre d'activit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle ou de renseignement ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s. Est-ce que je vous comprends bien? Merci beaucoup.",
        "334": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to ask the government regarding the evidence in front of the Court of First Instance. The judgment of the Court of First Instance refers to a document marked with sequential number 77, which contains the report, I quote from the judgment, the report in the result of the investigation, which consists, among other things, of Part H and I containing information about the plaintiff. I would like to ask you whether you can disclose anything about the content of this security file 77, and if you are in the position to explain whether this was a summary of an investigation or it contained original reports which were part of the investigation. In other words, was this a secondary summary information or was it an information file that contained the full dossier regarding reports, et cetera, et cetera? My second related question is that you did show us a document. Is this document the one that is referred to under number 77 in its totality? You also were kind enough to mention that with certain understandable restrictions, this document can be made available to the Court. So may I assume that this is now part of the file? And if so, is it accessible to the applicants' lawyers? If not, could you explain the legal reasons why this is not accessible to the Court? Thank you very much.",
        "335": "Thank you. I have two questions to both parties. The first one concerns the details of the labour law contract between the applicant and the ministry. What was the description of the position of the applicant in this contract? What were his duties and has there been in the contract a clause providing for the obligation to get a security clearance to fulfil those duties? And has there been any specific clause concerning determination of this contract included in the labour law contract? And then the second question. There are positions within the Ministry of Defence which require a security clearance. How this issue is regulated in domestic law? Is there a general regulation within the ministry which lists those positions or is this decided on an ad hoc basis but individual decisions? I would like to have more details on this issue of internal regulation within the ministry. How is the list of these positions requiring security clearance established? Thank you.",
        "336": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have also two questions, which mainly go to the government, but I invite the representatives for the applicant to comment if they so wish. The first one is as to the government's pleadings on admissibility. It's prompted by argumentation made by the agent before us today, which echoes paragraph 67 of your written brief, where you state that the present case does not concern a labor dispute having direct impacts on the applicant's employment at the Ministry of Defense. And it is, I think, an argument inviting the court not to apply the VO Escaline and presumption of Article VI applicability. I would like a bit of a clarification on this. On 5th September 2006, the National Security Authority withdraws the security clearance. Now, I see from this decision, which is in the file, that it is explicitly stated that as to its legal effects, it did not have suspensive effect were the applicant, as he did to administratively appeal the decision to the director of the agency. And I assume, therefore, judicial review proceedings did not have suspensive effect. So may I ask, on that date, 5th September 2006, when the decision took immediate effect, what impact did it have on the applicant's position? I appreciate that he resigned himself a month later. But was he able, de facto, to exercise his post in the ministry due to the fact that the security clearance was revoked? The reason I also ask this, and I want to draw the attention of the government to the Prague Municipal Court's decision in the case, the judgment of 1st December 2009, where it states, and this is on page 4, and this is an argument by the applicant, the applicant objected that he exercised the office of deputy defense minister and director of the property administration department of the Ministry of Defense, and as a consequence of the annulment of the certificate, he had to resign from his office. May I ask the government to comment that this is a pleading made by the applicant at domestic level and on the next page, the Prague Municipal Court views and examines this argument on the merits, referring to your constitutional provision on the right to exercise a profession, and states that but that right is subject to limitations under domestic law. May I ask you to comment on the context of these factual elements and the domestic court's assessment on your claim that it did not have an impact on the applicant's employment situation? My second question is on the merits. Just a clarification, under domestic law, I appreciate the National Security Authority was unable under domestic law in its decision to give reasons, but was under domestic law the administrative courts, were they, would it have been a possibility for them, assuming that they accepted that disclosure of the actual physical document was not possible, could they have obliged the National Security Authority to furnish the applicant with at least the gist or the essence of the reasons upon which the revocation of the certificate was based on? I make there a distinction between the actual document itself and the reasons so as to give the applicant an opportunity to present this case. Thank you very much, Mr. President.",
        "337": "Yeah, my question is this, both parties. The applicant became an employee of the Ministry of Defense by a labor contract. And then within this labor contract, first he was director of the administration of the ministry's assets, and then later, afterward, he was appointed deputy to the first vice minister of defense. Now, my question is concerning this last appointment, I would appreciate to know whether it was, this appointment was a free decision, that is to say, a decision at will of the appointed authority. I don't know whether it was the minister or the vice minister. Was it a free decision? And consequently, he was appointed for a fixed term in months or years, or could he be dismissed at will by this appointed authority? I say that because I would appreciate some clarification on the affirmation made by the government in paragraph 70 of his observation, because the government says, in accordance with the law, a public official could be removed from such an office at will by the holder of the power to appoint him or her. So this was a political appointment, that's my question. Thank you.",
        "338": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions, one to both parties, in relation to the question raised before by judges Wojtyczek, Spano, and L\u00f3pez Guerra. And I would like to know what was the exact status of the applicant under the law applicable at the relevant time. Was he a civil servant, technically speaking? The second question goes to the government. The relevant report of the intelligence service was classified as reserved. So apparently, it had a low level of classification. So in view of this, I am wondering whether it was possible to disclose the report in a redacted form, so as to protect the interests of the national security, while at the same time give a sense to the applicants, so as for him to prepare his defense. Thank you very much.",
        "339": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai des questions qui doublent les cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ants, celles d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9es par mes coll\u00e8gues, et c'est des questions et aussi des demandes de clarification parce que les repr\u00e9sentants ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 abord\u00e9 les questions. Ma premi\u00e8re question s'adresse plut\u00f4t au gouvernement. Est-ce que le gouvernement peut pr\u00e9ciser la relation entre le retrait de l'attestation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les poursuites p\u00e9nales engag\u00e9es dans la suite contre le requ\u00e9rant? Et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ces poursuites sont-elles la cons\u00e9quence de l'enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par les services secrets ayant donn\u00e9 lieu au retrait de l'attestation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9? J'ai une question ensuite aux deux partis, et qui sont dans la ligne de ce que mes coll\u00e8gues ont chaque fois abord\u00e9. Est-ce que les partis peuvent confirmer que sous l'empire de la l\u00e9gislation, en vigueur au moment des faits ayant donn\u00e9 lieu aux pr\u00e9sents litiges, il n'existait pas un droit de ch\u00e8que de fonction publique au sens traditionnel ou technique du terme, avec des droits et obligations particuliers pour les fonctionnaires, et que le statut des agents travaillant dans la fonction publique relevait du droit priv\u00e9? Y avait-il n\u00e9anmoins des obligations particuli\u00e8res pesant sur les agents travaillant pour des entit\u00e9s de droit public, et notamment d\u00e9coulant des sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s de leurs fonctions? La troisi\u00e8me question s'adresse au requ\u00e9rant. Est-ce que le requ\u00e9rant peut fournir, et elle est aussi dans la ligne de ce que mon coll\u00e8gue Spano a dit, est-ce que le requ\u00e9rant peut fournir des d\u00e9tails sur l'\u00e9volution de la carri\u00e8re, et surtout la fin de celle-ci? Peut-il en particulier livrer des explications sur ses soucis de sant\u00e9 qui l'ont emp\u00each\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 travailler dans la fonction publique? Peut-il confirmer ou infirmer qu'apr\u00e8s le retrait de l'attestation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le minist\u00e8re a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 lui trouver un autre emploi dans l'administration gouvernementale? Et que s'est-il pass\u00e9 au juste entre le retrait de l'attestation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9siliation d'un commun accord de la relation de travail? Car il y a eu une certaine p\u00e9riode entre ces deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Je vous remercie. Merci.",
        "340": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Tout d'abord, 2 questions adress\u00e9es au gouvernement. Le gouvernement a insist\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes fois en relation avec la gravit\u00e9 du comportement de M. Regner. Ma question est la suivante. Pourquoi est-ce qu'il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu, voire licenci\u00e9? 2e question, \u00e9galement destin\u00e9e au gouvernement. Est-ce que le juge instructeur ou l'autorit\u00e9 juridictionnelle comp\u00e9tente en R\u00e9publique tch\u00e8que, est-ce qu'il a jamais d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le secret de l'instruction? Et 3e question, donc dirig\u00e9e aux 2 partis. Quel est l'\u00e9tat actuel de la proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale? Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "341": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'aurais plusieurs questions. La 1re s'adresse aux 2 parties. Par un arr\u00eat du 21 mars 2012, la Cour supr\u00eame portugaise s'est prononc\u00e9e sur la demande de r\u00e9vision du proc\u00e8s introduite par la requ\u00e9rante. Je voudrais savoir, \u00e0 cette date du 21 mars 2012, quels \u00e9taient les effets pratiques de la condamnation? O\u00f9 en \u00e9tait la proc\u00e9dure d'ex\u00e9cution de la peine? 2e question, elle s'adresse aussi aux 2 parties.

Enfin, la derni\u00e8re question s'adresse au gouvernement. Je voudrais savoir si le gouvernement estime que notre arr\u00eat en date du 5 juillet 2011 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ou si cet arr\u00eat exige encore d'autres mesures d'ex\u00e9cution. Je vous remercie.",
        "342": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Mes questions sont li\u00e9es aux questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises par le juge Wojtyczek. D'abord, dans l'arr\u00eat de 2012 de la Cour supr\u00eame portugaise qui vient d'\u00eatre cit\u00e9e, vous avez la Cour en vogue le cas de \u00d6calan versus la Turquie.

Je vous remercie beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "343": "M. le Pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais poser une question \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00e9rante pour une certaine clarification. Parce que j'ai quelques doutes sur quel est exactement le contenu de la plainte de la requ\u00e9rante devant cette grande chambre. C'est-\u00e0-dire, devant la chambre, la plainte \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e sur la violation de l'article 6.1 de la Convention parce que la requ\u00e9rante n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue en personne par la Cour d'appel. Alors la chambre a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 qu'il y avait une violation et la requ\u00e9rante a pos\u00e9 une demande de r\u00e9vision devant la Cour supr\u00eame. La Cour supr\u00eame de Portugal l'a rejet\u00e9e. Maintenant, devant cette grande chambre, la plainte contre cet arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame est bas\u00e9e aussi, fond\u00e9e aussi, sur une nouvelle violation de l'article 6.1 de la Convention. Mais mon demande, c'est quelle est la cause exacte de la violation? C'est-\u00e0-dire, la cause, le fondement, c'est le m\u00eame que dans la requ\u00eate devant la chambre, c'est-\u00e0-dire que la requ\u00e9rante n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue ou la raison de la violation maintenant est une autre. Je ne sais pas quelle est la d\u00e9cision que l'arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame a fait arbitraire ou enraisonn\u00e9e, mais quelle est exactement la cause de la violation de l'article 6.1 qui se pose devant cette grande chambre?",
        "344": "Thank you, Madam President. I have several questions that I want to pose to the government and also to the applicants. Just to put my questions in context, there are three issues that are before the court for us to examine. Number one, was a CIA detention site operated in Romania in 2003 to 2005? And if so, was the applicant detained during that period? And thirdly, if both of those questions are answered affirmatively, can the applicant's detention and treatment in Romania be attributed to the Romanian government? So my first question goes to the government's arguments in the papers and also today during the pleadings as regards the Romanian authorities and government's awareness, assuming the first two questions were answered affirmatively. In other words, a detention site was there and that Mr. Al Nashiri was detained. I want to draw the government's attention to paragraph 441, subparagraph 4, of the Al Nashiri versus Poland judgment, which puts the awareness issue in a chronological context. There, the court found that already between January 2002 and August 2003, remember the allegation here is that the detention site in Romania was operational from 2003 to 2005, numerous public sources were consistently reporting ill treatment and abuse to which captured terrorist suspects were subjected in US custody in different places. Moreover, in the 2003 PACE resolution adopted in June 2003, of which Poland as any other contracting state, among them, of course, Romania, the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe was, and I quote, deeply concerned at the conditions of detention of captured unlawful combatants held in the custody of the US authorities. And the court found all these sources reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the US authorities that were manifestly contrary to the principles of the convention. Consequently, there were good reasons to believe that a person in US custody under the HVD program could be exposed to a serious risk of treatment contrary to those principles. My question to the Polish government is this, assuming, Romanian government is this, assuming that the first two questions that I mentioned were answered in the affirmative, how would you invite the court to distinguish your case and the circumstances in Romania as regards governmental awareness from the judicial facts found as regards to the situation in 2002 and 2003 in paragraph 441 of the Al Nashir versus Poland judgment? My second question goes to the issue, again, of awareness. And I want to draw the Romanian government's attention to two documents which I want clarification of, because they were not mentioned during your pleadings here today. On 13 December, 2014, an online version of Der Spiegel rendered, publishes an article which deals with information provided by the former Romanian chief of operations Ioan Talpe\u015f. In this article, in the verbatim English translation, it is stated that Mr. Talpe\u015f said that there were one or two locations in Romania at which the CIA, and I quote, probably held persons who were subjected to inhuman treatment. Talpe\u015f had previously confirmed the existence of, and I quote, a CIA transit camp, as he calls them in the Bucharest daily Adevarul. On June 8 of this year, the European Parliament issued a resolution. In this resolution, in paragraph 13, it is stated, the parliament recalls that the former director of the Romanian secret services, Ioan Talpe\u015f, admitted on record to the European Parliament delegation that he had been fully aware of the CIA's presence on Romanian territory, acknowledging that he had given permission to lease, I quote, lease a government building to the CIA. May I please ask the Romanian government to comment on the substance of these two documents and the relevance in the court's assessment? My third question goes to the effectiveness of the criminal investigation. And my question has two limbs. Firstly, may I ask, is it the contention of the Romanian government that the parliamentary inquiry itself concluded in 2008 that in and of itself was effective for the purposes of Article 3? In other words, the fact that we have a pending criminal complaint is not necessary for the resolution of the Article 3. In other words, if no criminal complaint would have all been invoked or established, then the parliamentary inquiry would itself be enough for Romania to have sufficiently exercised or sufficiently dealt with the issue under Article 3. And may I ask in that context, did the parliamentary inquiry have access to classified documents in its analysis? I know there is some issue on this in the papers, but please clarify. As regards to the criminal investigation, which was based on the applicant's criminal complaint of 29 May 2012, may I receive clarification of what is the status under statutory Romanian law of the applicant? Is he a formal victim under Romanian criminal procedural law? And if so, you mentioned that he had a right to be notified of procedural decisions and he had a right to be present during witness questioning. Could you please clarify what is the extent of his possible victim status position? My last question goes to both parties. And it deals with assuming that the applicant, Mr. Al Nashiri, was present on Romanian territory as a CIA detainee. May I draw the attention of both parties to page 73 of the US Senate report? On that page, it is stated, and I quote, in October 2004, 21 months after the final documented use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques against Al nashiri, an assessment by CIA contract interrogator Dunbar and other CIA interrogator concluded that Al Nashiri provided, and I quote, essentially no actionable information. And I quote, the probability that he has much more to contribute is low. There is then a reference in a footnote, 372, stating that in June 2005, the detention site Black, which the allegation is the Romanian site, chief of base suspended even these debriefings because it was, and I quote, the very, very rare moment that Alnashiri would recognize a photograph and because the debriefings often were the catalyst for his outbursts. May I, on this basis, ask both parties to comment on what they consider to be proven as the application of the EITs, the enhanced interrogation techniques, if the court were to conclude that Mr. Al Nashiri was indeed detained in that period, the reason I ask this is because it matters for the qualification by the court of an eventual assessment under Article 3 of the nature of the treatment that the applicant was subjected to. Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "345": "Merci beaucoup, Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente. C'est une question qui concerne le gouvernement, mais qui pourrait, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00eatre aussi comment\u00e9e par les requ\u00e9rants. J'ai entendu avec beaucoup d'int\u00e9r\u00eat les \u00e9l\u00e9ments fournis par l'agent du gouvernement au sujet des articles sur la responsabilit\u00e9 des Etats adopt\u00e9s par la Commission d'ordre international des Nations Unies en 2001 et plus particuli\u00e8rement au sujet des dispositions de ces articles concernant le probl\u00e8me, la question de l'attribution \u00e0 l'Etat. Et il ne fait pas de doute que ces articles, du moins ceux qui codifient, qui concernent l'attribution, codifient l'\u00e9tat actuel du droit international g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. La Cour internationale de justice l'a affirm\u00e9 au moins \u00e0 trois reprises. Mais de notre c\u00f4t\u00e9, le rapport du S\u00e9nat am\u00e9ricain de 2014 avance et r\u00e9p\u00e8te constamment que tous les sites de d\u00e9tention de la CIA en Europe et ailleurs ont pu fonctionner dans le respect de la souverainet\u00e9 de l'Etat concern\u00e9, dans le respect de la souverainet\u00e9 de l'Etat concern\u00e9. Et j'aimerais savoir comment est-ce que vous comprenez cette affirmation au regard des r\u00e8gles applicables en mati\u00e8re d'attribution que vous avez mentionn\u00e9es. Merci beaucoup.",
        "346": "Merci beaucoup. J'ai deux questions. La premi\u00e8re adress\u00e9e au gouvernement, la deuxi\u00e8me adress\u00e9e aux repr\u00e9sentants du requ\u00e9rant. En ce qui concerne la question pos\u00e9e au gouvernement, j'aimerais revenir un petit peu sur les statuts de vol qui ont atterri, notamment sur l'a\u00e9roport de Bonaissa, le gouvernement a soutenu dans ses observations \u00e9crites et aussi aujourd'hui dans sa plaidoirie, que ces vols n'avaient pas un statut sp\u00e9cial en ce qui concerne l'immunit\u00e9 pour les personnes se trouvant au bord de ces avions, ni \u00e0 part le fait qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral on a soutenu qu'il s'agissait tout simplement des scales techniques. Vu ces affirmations, j'invite le gouvernement \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser sa position \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'incident souffert le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2004, incident impliquant l'un de ces avions et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard duquel le rapport r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le Parlement europ\u00e9en fait mentionner le fait que les personnes se trouvant au bord de cet avion sont tout simplement disparues sans avoir pu \u00eatre v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es, sans avoir pu \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9es par la police de fronti\u00e8re. Donc j'aimerais avoir la position, le commentaire du gouvernement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cette affirmation-l\u00e0. La deuxi\u00e8me question, adress\u00e9 au representant du requ\u00e9rant, dans la mesure o\u00f9, supposons que les requ\u00e9rants aient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenus sur le territoire roumain, d'apr\u00e8s les repr\u00e9sentants du requ\u00e9rant, quel a \u00e9t\u00e9 le pays tiers vers lequel le requ\u00e9rant a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 apr\u00e8s sa d\u00e9tention en Roumanie et savoir si ce transfert vers ce pays tiers a aggrav\u00e9 de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit la situation juridique ou personnelle du requ\u00e9rant, \u00e7a veut dire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de son statut juridique, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du r\u00e9gime de d\u00e9tention, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des sanctions applicables, etc. Merci.",
        "347": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai quelques questions factuelles qui s'adressent aux deux parties, mais en fait, plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l'employeur qui n'est pas pr\u00e9sent. Et il ne s'agit pas \u00e0 proprement parler de questions, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e9galement de confirmations. Dans le m\u00e9moire du gouvernement, il est dit, et je cite, le 13 juillet 2007, dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire engag\u00e9e par son employeur, le requ\u00e9rant lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9clara avoir ouvert le compte de massagerie pour fournir des conseils techniques aux clients de l'entreprise. Alors, ma question, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'initiative de la cr\u00e9ation des comptes Yahoo, professionnels et priv\u00e9s au sein de l'entreprise? Le requ\u00e9rant l'a-t-il fait de sa propre initiative ou y a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 encourag\u00e9 par l'employeur? Et dans cette suite, l'employeur \u00e9tait-il au courant de l'ouverture par le requ\u00e9rant de deux comptes dont l'un \u00e9tait priv\u00e9 et l'autre \u00e9tait professionnel, mais les deux fonctionnaient sur le mat\u00e9riel informatique de l'entreprise? Ca, c'est ma premi\u00e8re question. La deuxi\u00e8me question, je me r\u00e9f\u00e8re au r\u00e8glement d'ordre int\u00e9rieur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 en partie dans le jugement, o\u00f9 il est dit, il est strictement interdit de troubler l'ordre et la discipline dans les cours de l'entreprise, et en particulier d'utiliser les ordinateurs, photocopieurs, t\u00e9l\u00e9phones, t\u00e9l\u00e9scripteurs, etc. \u00e0 des fins personnelles. Par ailleurs, dans la note d'information circul\u00e9e le 3 juillet 2007, il est dit, le temps pass\u00e9 dans l'entreprise doit \u00eatre de qualit\u00e9 pour tout le monde. Venez au travail pour vous occuper des probl\u00e8mes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, de votre travail, et non pas des probl\u00e8mes priv\u00e9s. Ne passez pas votre temps \u00e0 occuper les lignes Internet, t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, etc. Est-ce que les interdictions se rapportaient seulement \u00e0 l'usage du mat\u00e9riel mis \u00e0 disposition par l'employeur? Ou est-ce que l'interdiction a \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, dans le sens qu'on ne devait m\u00eame pas l'utiliser pendant les heures de travail, ses propres moyens de communication, si tant est qu'il en existait en 2007, comme des portables priv\u00e9s, etc.? Dans ce contexte, l'usage du compte personnel \u00e9tait-il autoris\u00e9 ou tol\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'employeur? Une derni\u00e8re question qui \u00e9tait... Je crois qu'elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pondue, mais une confirmation serait la bienvenue. Quel est le moment exact auquel l'employeur a imprim\u00e9 les messages qu'il avait pr\u00e9alablement enregistr\u00e9s avant ou apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration du salari\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait de messages professionnels? Merci.",
        "348": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai aussi une question factuelle. Le gouvernement a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le requ\u00e9rant, lui-m\u00eame a diffus\u00e9 le contenu des messages pendant le proc\u00e8s, c'\u00e9tait pas l'employeur. Mais est-ce que les transcriptions des communications priv\u00e9es du requ\u00e9rant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues publiques d\u00e9j\u00e0, je dirais, par l'employeur? C'est-\u00e0-dire, est-ce qu'il a divulgu\u00e9 ces communications aux coll\u00e8gues, aux salari\u00e9s au sein de l'entreprise? Parce que le requ\u00e9rant a ce griff\u00e9 au paragraphe 82 de ses observations, mais l\u00e0, il manque de d\u00e9tails, il n'y a pas assez de pr\u00e9cisions. Donc, moi, je dirais que, comme le gouvernement a dit, il y a une diff\u00e9rence, bien s\u00fbr, entre l'enregistrement, l'examen et la v\u00e9rification, et l'examen des messages par l'employeur, mais je dirais qu'il existe aussi une grande diff\u00e9rence, une grande, importante diff\u00e9rence entre la v\u00e9rification et l'examen et la divulgation des messages au sein de l'article 8. Et donc, par rapport \u00e0 \u00e7a, j'aimerais aussi savoir, et surtout par le requ\u00e9rant, est-ce que ce griff\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 devant les juridictions internes? Voila, merci beaucoup.",
        "349": "Thank you very much. I also would have a factual question. I understand that on 3rd July 2007, as is said in the observations of the government, paragraph 11, a company-wide notice was registered with the Bucharest office. And then it was signed one by one by the employees. I would like to understand the communication policy in this respect. What does it mean it was registered? And was it only a paper version that was given from hand to hand, one by the other? Or was it also communicated electronically? Or was it even put on the blackboard in the enterprise? So how could the employees take notice of this note, just to understand, because we don't know this exactly when he knew it, between this period of 3rd July to 13th July. And the second question I would have, as my colleague Judge Ravarani has said, we have these two parallel accounts, the personal account and the professional account. And as they were parallel, I would like to understand the way of using it on the side of the employee. Did he make a difference in using the personal account and the professional account? And also for the employer, did the employer make a difference in monitoring the personal account and the professional account? Thank you.",
        "350": "Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Pour ma part, je voudrais revenir sur un argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le gouvernement d\u00e9fendeur et dont il nous dit qu'il est inspir\u00e9 par les informations donn\u00e9es par la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration europ\u00e9enne des syndicats parties tierces intervenantes. Si j'ai bien compris la position du gouvernement sur ce point, il y aurait trois niveaux d'intensit\u00e9 dans la surveillance qu'un employeur peut exercer \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des communications pass\u00e9es par un employ\u00e9. Le premier niveau, le plus bas, serait celui d'un simple contr\u00f4le des flux. Le nombre de communications, le temps pass\u00e9 dans ces communications, leur dur\u00e9e. Un niveau interm\u00e9diaire serait celui de l'interception de ces communications, mais sans acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leur contenu, ces communications \u00e9tant alors conserv\u00e9es, notamment pour r\u00e9server une preuve si n\u00e9cessaire dans un contentieux ult\u00e9rieur, ou pour interroger le salari\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame sur le caract\u00e8re priv\u00e9 ou professionnel de ces conversations intercept\u00e9es, mais non ouvertes. Le troisi\u00e8me niveau, le niveau ultime, serait celui de l'interception avec acc\u00e8s imm\u00e9diat au contenu de ces \u00e9changes. Le gouvernement, si j'ai bien compris sa position, nous dit que, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, dans cette affaire, l'employeur aurait pratiqu\u00e9 le niveau de surveillance interm\u00e9diaire, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'il aurait not\u00e9 que le flux des communications \u00e9tait, je mets des guillemets, suspect, qu'il aurait alors intercept\u00e9 ces communications, ces messages, mais sans avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leur contenu, qu'il aurait ensuite interrog\u00e9 le salari\u00e9, le requ\u00e9rant, sur leur nature professionnelle ou priv\u00e9e, et que ce n'est que parce que le requ\u00e9rant aurait r\u00e9pondu que ces communications \u00e9taient professionnelles, qu'il n'avait que des communications professionnelles, qu'il aurait alors acc\u00e9d\u00e9 au contenu de ces informations. Je voudrais, d'une part, que le gouvernement me dise si j'ai bien compris cette argumentation et si elle est soutenue factuellement comme \u00e9tant soit \u00e9tablie, soit probable, soit hypoth\u00e9tique. Et je voudrais que les conseils du requ\u00e9rant nous disent, sur le plan factuel, ce qu'ils pensent de cette analyse, et sur le plan juridique, \u00e0 supposer qu'il en soit ainsi, comment r\u00e9agissent-ils. Voil\u00e0 ma question, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "351": "Thank you very much, I'd like to ask a first very simple question to the government, the government mentioned that there were some remedies that could have been exhausted by the applicant, does that mean that there is now a formal objection to the admissibility of the application based of non-exhaustion of these remedies. And the second question is to both parties and it is of a factual nature and it is somewhat in the line of what my colleague Mr. Potocki has asked. If I can see, or the government attached to its observations the charge showing the internet traffic. And it shows that the applicant has had much more, made much more use of the internet than some other employees. I don't know whether these are all the employees. I see that there are in total seven employees mentioned. My question is, this actually prompted the disciplinary proceedings by the employer. Was there also a rule on the excessive use of internet and in particular on the excessive use of Yahoo messenger by the employees? Whether private or professional. Was the use of the Yahoo messenger in itself something suspect within the firm? Was this high use of the Yahoo messenger an indication that it was being used for private purposes? And then I come a bit to the situation or the questions raised by my colleague. If the high use of the Yahoo messenger was already an indication of a private use, why then still ask the applicant whether he used it for professional purposes? I would like to, it's not, it's in fact a question to the employer, but I would like to know whether the parties have something to say about this. Thank you.",
        "352": "I have a question to both parties. You both said about legitimate expectations, and I understand both parties had legitimate expectations in this case. And can we, and can you say that it is possible, instead of legitimate expectations of privacy, in some circumstances, or in the context of this case, this particular case, there could be legitimate expectations that the privacy could be limited, or even monitored? And the second question is about the proportionality, whether the use of Internet for private correspondence was too much. So it's not a quick question between the relatives, just the call for emergency, or that we have 45 pages of correspondence. Isn't it too much for using, enjoying privacy in a working environment? And the question to the government, whether there was also no proportionality enjoyed by the employer when monitoring without or with any cause, just because it was the equipment belonging to the company, that's all, or there was any cause for monitoring. Or it is the case that we call as a mass surveillance case within the limits of working environment. Thank you.",
        "353": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. Actually, I have a couple of questions to both parties in regard to their recent observations. And I will start first with the government observations. At paragraph 6 of your observations, you say that on October 1999, when the applicant was arrested, the authorities conducted a series of investigative measures. They interviewed the applicants, accomplished witnesses, friends of the suspects, and anyone who could in some manner relate to the events. Evidential material was gathered in a systematic manner, and I underline the word systematic. In paragraph 9, you say that on 3rd of October, based on the applicant's submissions \u2013 and I don't know what submissions you mean \u2013 and the investigators' detention order of the 4th of October, he was taken to a police arrest and then to the Sofia Investigative Detention Facility. On paragraph 10, you say that on the 4th of October, the investigator in Berkas, the one in charge of the case, issued an order for the applicant's detention for 24 hours. On paragraph 11, you say that the applicant was examined by the doctor and a forensic doctor. In paragraph 13, you admit that there was an investigation file. But despite the above, you say that there was no trace of any interview of the applicants during these three days. My first question is, how do you explain this? And the second question is, in relation to this period, do you say categorically that there is no record proving that the applicant was asked any question whatsoever, even to state his name? And how do you explain the investigator of Berkas to issue an order for detention on 4th of October without the applicant being asked any question? Now, in relation to \u2013 the second question refers to the applicant. In paragraph 42 of the observations, the applicant argues that it may be that the assistance of a lawyer during the first three days of interrogation would not have resulted in his acquittal. On the other hand, the government, at paragraph 38 of their observation, underline that the applicant does not argue that any particular statements made by him between the 3rd and the 6th of October were later used in the criminal proceedings. Based on the above statements, and with a retrospective look, could the applicant be more specific? I know that you answered the question, but could you be more specific how the lack of a lawyer between the 3rd and the 6th of October had any effect whatsoever on the subsequent proceedings before the domestic courts, on any of the applicant's substantive or procedural rights and on the fairness of the trial as a whole? Thank you very much.",
        "354": "Thank you very much. I would like to ask a question to both parties. It has been argued by the applicant that when the applicant saw a lawyer on the 6th of October, that was Mr. Todorov, the appointed lawyer, that he was not able to meet that lawyer before the interrogation by the investigator. And I quote from paragraph 33 of the submissions of the applicant, that indeed, all his meetings with lawyers during the pre-trial proceedings were conducted in the office of the investigator, with the latter always being present. End of quote. I would like to ask whether, according to the parties, this is indeed part of the complaint, because we are now on the 6th of October for the first time in interrogation with a lawyer. And if so, whether the government has something to say about the presence of other people during the conversation between the applicant and his lawyer. There's something unclear about what this statement means in the context of the whole case. And I would like to ask the parties to clarify this. Thank you.",
        "355": "My question is for counsel for the applicant, but the government might comment if they wish so, of course. My question is with respect to the argument that the right to access to a lawyer should not necessarily be linked to the overall assessment of the fairness of the trial. What would then be the remedy of a finding of a violation, is my question. And more specifically, with respect to the reopening of the proceedings, what would be the possible standards in more general terms for reopening and in the specific circumstances of the present case? Thank you.",
        "356": "Just some information from the government. The applicant was arrested the 3rd of October. He remained arrested for the 3rd, the 4th, the 5th, the 6th of October. No lawyer was appointed. It seems that no evidence was gathered during these two or three days. No case paper shows that the applicant was questioned by the police. He was not involved in any other investigative measure. No investigation parade or any kind of other biological sampling or anything. My question is, what was the reason for this negative situation? Why the government decided, or the police decided, to have the applicant arrested? Was there any reason for not doing any kind of these investigation activities, appointing him a lawyer or something like that? Was there any reason for this lack of activity by the police?",
        "357": "Thank you. My first question concerns the government. The Bulgarian legislation provides and provided already in 1999 the assistance of a lawyer from the moment of the arrest of a suspect. However, as you cited, the CPT report from 2015 still notes systemic deficiencies in the implementation of these provisions. How do you comment on this? Second question, if the applicant had made any confession in the first three days of arrest, as he claims, would he have had the right to challenge its admission before the Bulgarian courts? And my further question concerns the applicant. You complain about the absence of a lawyer in the first three days of detention from 3rd to 6th of October 1999. Why didn't you put emphasis on complaining about this at the domestic level? And a separate further complaint concerns the de facto irreducibility of life sentence from 2001 to 2012. However, as you know, it was declared inadmissible with the court's decision of 23rd of August 2011. Why don't you consider to lodge a new complaint on this point? Thank you.",
        "358": "Thank you, Mr. President. Very short, very short question. I would ask both parties to comment a submission from the end of the paragraph 29 of the observations of the applicant. When applicant asked for a lawyer first time, that Mr. Mihailov's name and the phone number was given to him, but was simply told in the response that he had seen too many movies and this was not America. I would like short comments about concerning this part of the statement. Thank you.",
        "359": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My first question is composed of two branches, but it's addressed to both parties. The government referred to the advisory opinion requested by the tax administration from the Data Protection Ombudsman in 2000 and 2001. And what I'd like the government to do is to clarify a little what advice the ombudsman provided and what was requested of or indicated to the applicant companies at that stage. The same question is addressed in a different form to the applicant companies. Could the applicants explain why, after that opinion, and request for further information by the tax administration, they cancelled their access request and hired people to collect the data manually from the tax offices? That's my first factual question. The other two questions are of a more legal nature. And again, they're addressed to both parties. But principally, the second question is addressed to the respondent government. And it relates to the issue of the quantum of data accessed and disseminated. In terms of reliance on the journalistic purposes derogation in Section 2.5 of the Finnish legislation and Article 9 of the EU directive, where is the cutoff point regarding quantum? And how are journalists to establish what it is? I stress that this question relates only to quantum, a separate question, of course, arising, as the respondent government pointed out, as to the manner of dissemination. And my third question is again addressed to both parties. The taxation data at issue here is, as both of you have emphasized, it's public in the sense that it is publicly accessible, subject to the rules established under Finnish law. The government has partly addressed this question, but I'd like you both to return to it. Should this factor be determinative in the court's assessment of the balancing exercise undertaken by domestic courts under Articles 8 and 10? And if not, what other considerations, particularly relating to data protection, are relevant to the balancing of rights which domestic courts have to engage in? Thank you.",
        "360": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to pose one question to the representative of the applicants. Of course, the government is also free to comment on it. In your written and also oral submissions, one of your key arguments is that the Data Protection Act was not meant at all to restrict any publishing activities concerning personal data. And my question is this. In the Data Protection Act, as well as in the EU directive on which the act is based, as well as in the new general data protection regulation that has been adopted earlier this year in the EU, in all of these legislative instruments, it is expressly provided that the processing of personal data does cover, among other things, the disclosure by transmission, the dissemination, and other making available of personal data. So in light of these express provisions, I would ask the applicants' representative to explain to the court on what basis you maintain that the data protection legislation is not intended at all to restrict any publishing of personal data. And secondly, it would also be interesting to hear your views on the implications for data protection if data protection cannot cover the dissemination of personal data at all, or if it cannot in any way extend to the dissemination of personal data in case the disseminator declares that he is a journalist. Thank you.",
        "361": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. C'est une question au gouvernement, mais il est bien \u00e9vident que les requ\u00e9rants pourraient commenter \u00e9galement. Je serais tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ress\u00e9 d'entendre \u00e9galement les commentaires des requ\u00e9rants. Vous avez parl\u00e9, madame, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de l'intime conviction. Vous l'avez mentionn\u00e9, r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9. Et vous avez dit une phrase qui rel\u00e8ve, qui est mentionn\u00e9e \u00e9galement dans vos observations \u00e9crites, l'opinion des jur\u00e9s \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 faite.

Est-ce que pour arriver \u00e0 cette intime conviction, il y a des instructions de la part du pr\u00e9sident de la cour d'assises? Est-ce que le pr\u00e9sident am\u00e8ne les jur\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser un peu leur intime conviction? Est-ce que le standard de preuve est, au-del\u00e0 de tout doute, raisonnable? Comment est-ce que l'on arrive \u00e0 cette intime conviction dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des faits, dans la pratique judiciaire belge? Merci beaucoup.",
        "362": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have also a number of questions. I think some of them are similar to what my colleague has just asked. Well, my first question, and I assume that I would like to hear it directly from both parties, is that under Belgian law, the question of criminal responsibility, that is whether a person is sane or insane according to law, not medically speaking, but sane or insane according to law, I assume that that is a question of fact and not a question of law. If that assumption is correct, that it is a question of fact and not a question of law, in other words, a question to be decided by the jury and not a question to be decided by the court or the professional judges, please correct me. I'm assuming that it is a question of fact. The second question is, in the Belgian legal system, when experts are heard, are the rules governing the assessment of ordinary witnesses the same as that governing experts? In other words, are experts in some way under the Belgian system regarded as having more probative value than an ordinary witness? Or are the rules for the assessment of ordinary witnesses the same as those which apply for experts? The third question is, and this I believe the agent for the government has referred to this, the question of whether the jurors, in saying yes or no to the questions, whether they actually indicate the vote by which they have come to that conclusion. How is this voting system, if at all, if it exists? Because I understood that you mentioned four to three, if I understood correctly. I may be wrong. Or is the vote simply yes or no without indicating whether it's unanimous or whether it's a majority vote? I would like to understand how this system works. The fourth question is directed really to the applicant. When the questions which were going to be put to the jury were presented to the Fence Council, am I correct to assume that at that particular point in time, the Fence Council was in agreement that the questions were correctly and sufficiently clear for the jurors to perform their duty? Because according to my notes, from what I read from the documents, there was no contestation by the Fence Council as to the questions which were put to the jury. But I would like some clarification on that point. My colleague has already asked the question as to the summing up or to the address to the lay jurors. In particular, in this case, in this particular case, if there was the summing up, in other words, if the president of the court did address the lay jurors, was there any explanation given as to the legal significance of the words, not the popular significance, but the legal significance of the words knowingly, intentionally, and premeditated within the context of the definition of willful homicide in Belgian law? And finally, my last question is, how do the professional judges, because I cannot understand how this works in spite of everything I've read so far, how do the professional judges liaise with, if at all, with the lay jury in drafting the reasoning subsequently? Do they submit the draft of the judgment to the lay jurors? How is this? Because I understand that the professional judges were not present in the deliberations. That much I understand. But how then can these judges actually give a judgment which sums up the reasoning of the lay judges, that is, of the jurors, without there being some form of interaction between them or liaising between them? Thank you very much indeed.",
        "363": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to the government. So is there in the Belgium legislation a provision obliging the relevant judicial authority to explain its judgment at the request or ex officio to the sentenced person? Thank you.",
        "364": "Beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai peut-\u00eatre une question technique que je n'ai pas tout \u00e0 fait comprise. L'article 352 du Code d'instruction criminelle belge, je crois, pr\u00e9voit que si les magistrats professionnels ne sont pas d'accord avec le verdict du jury, ils ont le droit de renvoyer l'affaire \u00e0 un autre jury. Et comment cela s'agence-t-il? Est-ce que cela veut dire qu'ils ont un droit de regard sur le verdict du jury? Est-ce qu'ils font le verdict? Est-ce qu'ils \u00e9pousent le verdict? Et quelle est la pratique? Est-ce que cela se pratique que des verdicts du jury soient renvoy\u00e9s \u00e0 un autre jury? Quelle est alors l'int\u00e9rf\u00e9rence des magistrats professionnels dans le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9? ...",
        "365": "Thank you, Mr. President. My questions are addressed to both parties. Paragraph 24 of the chamber judgment says the following. On the 5th of March, 1998, he was examined by a doctor who judged the situation to be under control. His condition deteriorated the following day, 6th of March. He was examined by a doctor who diagnosed a possible perforated viscose. It was decided that he should undergo surgery on the 6th of March. The surgery took place on the 7th of March, late in the evening. There's a lapse of time of more than 24 hours between the decision and the surgery. The government never disputed this fact, nor this lapse of time. Now the applicant in the application, the first initial application, said that this was explained by the lack of medical staff, specialized medical staff. I read the application, the relevant part. The condition of the patient was deplorable. His belly was completely swollen. The pain was desperate. He had breathing, intense sweating, and sleepy. He was unrecognizable. He was in a horrible situation. He was desperately asking for oxygen, and he was unable to urinate. It was necessary to insert a urinary catheter, but nothing could be done without a medical prescription. But there was no doctor. In many efforts, and in an atmosphere of panic, which also affected other patients, a doctor came from the emergency department. However, as soon as he saw the patient, he refused to do anything. The doctor mentioned that the patient seemed to be in a serious health condition. He also mentioned that he was not an expert, and he did not know the patient. For that reason, he would have to wait for a colleague from the department. Now the hours go on, and in the afternoon, around 3 p.m., another doctor comes and saw the patient and left. He then came back with a surgeon, and this is the description. The surgeon was trying to understand how that could have happened so fast. He was informed that the patient was like that for more than 24 hours. The doctor immediately started preparing the patient for the surgery and giving instructions to the nurses. Saturday afternoon. We know that the first attempt to get the surgery done was not successful. He was taken out of the surgery room, and late in the evening, then at 8 p.m., he was finally operated. My question is what the government has to say to this. The government never pronounced a word about this lapse of time. Now is the time to give a reply to this. This leads me to the other structural issue at stake. Was there a structural problem at a relevant time, at that time, in both hospitals, not only in the hospital of Vila Nova de Gaia, but also at the Porto Hospital? And was this investigated properly at the national level? The structural issue. Now we have a report from the Panel of Infectious Diseases from 1999, so the very first report on the incident, from the Portuguese Medical Association, which identifies clearly a structural issue, a structural problem. And they even make a suggestion. They say, we alert once again, I'm quoting, once again, so this is not the first time that they are drawing the attention of the authorities to the problem. We alert once again for the need to consider the creation of an infectious disease department in hospitals like the one, so it's a systemic problem that is here identified, department in hospitals like the one of Vila Nova de Gaia, in order to improve their care quality. My question to the government is the following. Was there an investigation with regard to this allegation by the Col\u00e9gio da Especialidade de Doen\u00e7as Infecciosas, by the Panel of Infectious Diseases panel? We know that the criminal investigation against one doctor only took into account the behavior, the conduct of this doctor until the 3rd of February, 1998. Nothing else. Was there an investigation on this issue raised by the Panel of Infectious Diseases of the Portuguese Medical Association? Was there a reply to this, to this alert that is made in the very final sentence of the report? We also know that there was a civil action against two hospitals and nine, eight medical doctors, but we know as well that eight doctors were found not to have standing in this procedure, so the scope of the investigation of the civil action was also limited. The question remains, was there a structural issue, was there a structural problem, as pointed out by the Panel of Infectious Diseases, and if yes, was it addressed, and by what means? Thank you very much. Thank you.",
        "366": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. C'est une question adress\u00e9e essentiellement aux requ\u00e9rants, mais j'appr\u00e9cierais \u00e9galement la r\u00e9action du gouvernement. Ma\u00eetre, vous avez parl\u00e9 d'un dysfonctionnement des services hospitaliers, d'un grave manque d'assistance m\u00e9dicale, voire d'une privation de soins. Ce sont vos paroles tout \u00e0 l'heure. Ma question est la suivante. Elle va dans le sens de mon coll\u00e8gue. Est-ce que vous croyez que ces dysfonctionnements sont syst\u00e9miques et structurels? Autrement dit, est-ce que vous croyez que ces dysfonctionnements r\u00e9v\u00e8lent des carences plus profondes du syst\u00e8me hospitalier local ou bien qu'il s'agissait de dysfonctionnements simplement occasionnels? Merci.",
        "367": "Thank you, Mr. President. I also have questions which are directed at the applicant's invitation to the court to appreciate the facts in a certain manner. As I see from the pleadings of the applicant before the court, in general, the use of words like lack of promptness, diligence, delay in the diagnostic part of the post-operative infection in November 1997, and also in Chapter C of your pleadings, a reference to the delay as just mentioned by my colleague, Judge de Albuquerque, the issue of the delay from 6 to 8 March as regards to surgery. May I ask, was the way in which the applicant pled this at domestic level in the civil proceedings based on an allegation of medical negligence on the particular facts? Or was it based also on the existence of, and this is Judge Siciliano's question, I'm not basically asking you for how you're pleading before this court, but how you pled the issue in the civil proceedings before the domestic courts. In other words, were the domestic courts confronted with an allegation of a dysfunctionality or a systemic problem, or was the allegation that on the particular facts of this case there had been medical negligence in the application of treatment? The reason I ask, as you know, the court has said that it cannot accept that errors of judgment or lack of coordination between health officials can in and of itself constitute a violation of the substantive limit. So could you clarify the way in which the issue was pled by the applicant at domestic level? My second point is directed at the events of 6 to 8 March, 1998. I see from the Supreme Administrative Court judgment, which is before us, page 36 to 37, established facts A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B, and C, C, C, C, which deals with these issues where the court finds, and I will read this in French because this is what we have in front of us. Les examens de 6 Mars radiographiques et \u00e9chographiques abdominaux pelvienne n'ont pas permis de confirmer un quelconque perforation du colon ou de doux au d\u00e9nume cependant la situation en esp\u00e8ce devait \u00eatre surveill\u00e9e. And then the next established fact: c'est seulement le 7 mars que le syndrome abdominale a \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9e avec l'exigence d'une intervention chirurgical-urgente. May I ask, on what basis would the applicant invite the court to call into question these established facts according to the administrative courts? Could you refer the court to the elements of the dossier which would allow the court, in your view, to call into question these judicial facts as found by the First Instance Court and relied upon by the Supreme Administrative Court? Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "368": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. A couple of questions, which are kindly addressed to both parties. What was the general condition of the health of the applicant's husband on the 26th of November of 1997, apart from his nasal problem? Mr. Fernandes said that the applicant's husband was a strong man at that time. Is there any concrete evidence on this? This is the first question. The second question. Mrs. Carvalho argued that there was a legal or a regulatory framework governing the functioning of emergency units and making inadequate provision for the protection of lives of patients. What was the exact context of these alleged regulations? And lastly, were these alleged regulations actually applied in the present case? And if yes, in what way? Thank you very much.",
        "369": "Thank you Mr. President. One very short question for both parties. Why the autopsy of the applicant's husband's body had not been carried out? And had this issue been raised in a domestic proceeding?",
        "370": "Thank you. I would just like to follow up the question by Judge Spano in terms of the domestic framework and the possibility at the domestic level to deal with systemic or structural failures in the health system. Is there a possibility for that? Thank you.",
        "371": "My first two questions are about Article 3, and they concern the government. The government have stressed the challenges it faced in connection with the huge immigrant flow in 2011. And now, in your oral intervention, you even gave up some figures. You said that there were 51,000 in 2011, of which 26,000 came from Tunis. These were the figures you referred to just now. Now, in the pleadings in this case, in writing, it has been argued that the crisis or the flow, the influx in September 2011 was not really so unexpected because there had been similar flows previously. Do you consider that a valued argument or not? That was my first question to the government concerning Article 3. My next question to the government concerning Article 3 relates to the conditions at the center in September. And there you have stressed that the chamber has put too much emphasis on reports from 2009 and May 2011. That was when these two visits by the Senate and the parliamentary assembly delegation took place. You say it's unfair. May I ask you, what is your view, if you should be a little bit more precise, what were then the exact conditions in September 2009? And I know that you have indicated this, but a little bit more detail. Three elements as regards overcrowding, as regards the way meals were being digested, and as regards sanitary facilities. These were the three elements I focused on. These were the questions to the government. Now I have questions to both parties. But I will start here to take as a point of departure the government's emphasis on the fact that there were two phases. First, there was a compulsory individual talk. And this question relates, of course, to Protocol 4, Article 4. That's what we are in now. And you stressed that there were two phases in the interviewing process, so to speak. The first was the compulsory individual talk with the identification of the immigrant by personnel of the police operators and an interpreter. When it comes to that first phase, what was the focus of the conversations with the individuals during that first round? I take it that it was to establish the nationality and certainly also the identification and taking of fingerprint of the individual concerned. But what about any other elements? You have indicated in your oral intervention that there was also information about the opportunity offered by the system to the immigrant. What does this element, information, imply? That was the first phase. Now I move on to a similar question relating to the second phase. There, there were these individual conversations with the Tunisian consular authority aimed at ascertaining, again, nationality. And then the government says, and the absence of possible obstacles to repatriation. The absence of possible obstacles to repatriation. That element, does that follow from the bilateral agreement? Or is that element rather a way you are using to describe the practice? Was this then done in practice? And what, who would then raise possible concerns in that connection? You have said that the applicants, and this is the third question, and again, the applicants are also invited to comment if they so wish, just like with my previous two, had information about their positions since their landing. Which kind of information are we here referring to? Some kind of general information in which language? It's also stated that there were many opportunities to see the, to raise their situation. Many opportunity to make requests. What is this referring to? I suppose it's the individuals initiative that we are talking about here. And finally, and this question is linked in a way to this individualization issue under protocol four, article four, and it's stated in the oral intervention today that 72 asylum seekers and vulnerable people were actually transferred from the center to other destinations. And that was done in the same period as the applicant in the present case arrived and were there. Now this separation, was that in any way linked to phase one or phase two? Or how can that separation be explained? Thank you. These are my questions.",
        "372": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. This is a question to the government, but of course the applicant may wish to comment also. In your written observations, you made the distinction between a refusal of entry and an expulsion. And you say that the applicants were issued with individual refusal of entry orders. So as far as I understand, you seem to challenge the very applicability of Article 4, of Protocol 4, saying that we don't have to do with an expulsion, we have to do with something else, a refoulement or a refusal of entry. Today in your oral presentation, as far as I understood you, but I would like to have a confirmation of this, you seem somehow to change your stance a bit. You seem to take into account the court's case law, you referred to the CONCACA judgments and to the standards established in the CONCACA judgment, namely the necessity of having a reasonable objective examination of the particular case of each individual alien of the group, and you have said that the applicants were heard about their individual needs, there was an assessment of their individual position, they were heard in their mother tongue, and there was a concrete opportunity to submit an application of asylum. Well, the applicant affirmed that their right to be heard was not respected. So apparently, if I understand well, we move from a legal difference concerning the applicability of Article 4 to a factual difference of positions. And I would like to have the opportunity to go more in depth into this issue from possibly both sides. Thank you very much.",
        "373": "Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai plusieurs questions aux deux parties concernant les accords internationaux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s dans cette affaire. Le gouvernement italien invoque, dans les observations \u00e9crites devant la grande chambre, deux accords internationaux entre l'Italie et la Tunisie, l'accord de 1998 et le proc\u00e8s verbal de 2005. Par ailleurs, l'arr\u00eat de chambre examine un troisi\u00e8me accord international entre ces deux Etats, l'accord de 2011. Nous avons donc trois accords internationaux entre l'Italie et la Tunisie. La premi\u00e8re question concerne la place de ces trois accords internationaux dans l'ordre juridique italien. Sont-ils parties int\u00e9grantes de l'ordre juridique italien? Sont-ils directement applicables? La deuxi\u00e8me question concerne leur statut dans l'ordre international. Selon l'article 102 de la Charte de l'ONU, tout accord international doit \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du secr\u00e9tariat de l'ONU. Et ce m\u00eame principe est confirm\u00e9 par l'article 80 de la Convention de Vienne sur les droits de trait\u00e9. Je voulais savoir si les deux parties \u00e0 ces accords internationaux, l'Italie et la Tunisie, ont rempli leurs obligations d\u00e9coulant de l'article 102 de la Charte de l'ONU et de l'article 80 de la Convention de Vienne sur les droits de trait\u00e9. Enfin, la troisi\u00e8me question, toujours concernant ces trois accords internationaux, peuvent-ils \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s devant la Cour europ\u00e9enne des droits de l'homme? Je voudrais avoir l'opinion de deux parties sur cette question. Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "374": "Thank you very much. I would have one question in addition to the question of Judge Wojtyczek. Why was the agreement not published? Why was it secret? And then I would have a question to the lawyers on the applicants. You talk about a procedural right to be heard and you say that it was not enough to identify them to ask them about nationality and the country to which to be sent back. But at the same time you say they don't want to claim asylum, they don't want international protection. So what arguments would the applicants have liked to advance to tell the Italian authorities in order to change the situation, in order to stay in the country if they don't want to claim asylum? What arguments would they have liked to be heard with? Thank you.",
        "375": "Yeah, I would like to ask a question to the government concerning Article 3. You started your presentation by referring to the pressing needs that the authorities had to deal during the emergency of influx of migrants. And you also, in your written observations, referred to the separate opinion of Judges Shayo and Vucinic, who also show the need to respond to the emergency situation. And I wonder, is there a room under Article 3 to take into account emergency circumstances when we are deciding on the minimum level of severity under Article 3 in the context of the conditions of detention? Thank you.",
        "376": "Thank you very much. I would have a question to the applicants. I quote the judgment of the appeal court of 16th May 2005. There it's written on the basis, I quote, on the basis of SC's statement, the court establishes that at the meeting that preceded the preparation of the letter, a distinguished member of a defendant had informed those attending the meeting that the plaintiff had given a statement to the newspaper which was identical to the content stated in the letter. And then it continues, upon a subsequent verification, SC established that such a text had been published, but that the plaintiff had not been the author. So here it's just written in the court's judgment, upon a subsequent verification. I would like to know when has this subsequent verification taken place? Was it before the letter was sent to the authorities or was it afterwards? If it was afterwards, why was it not done before? And why was it not, if it was afterwards, why was the letter then not verified as it was known that she was not the author? Thank you.",

Je voudrais en effet savoir \u00e0 quel moment pr\u00e9cis vous avez appris que Mme S. n'\u00e9tait pas l'auteur de l'interview au journal N\u00eenes, le journal serbe N\u00eenes. 1re question, le moment pr\u00e9cis, je pense que c'est quelque chose d'important dans la compr\u00e9hension du dossier. Et la 2e question qui rejoint aussi la question qui vient d'\u00eatre pos\u00e9e, lorsque vous l'avez su, lorsque vous l'avez appris, pourquoi n'\u00eates-vous pas all\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement d\u00e9mentir cette information aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s, des hautes autorit\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s desquelles elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9es?

        "378": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for the government. Did you make any inquiry as to the content of the letter received by the applicant? That's the first question. And second question, what steps you have taken in order to find out if the content of the letter was disseminated by some body of Br\u010dko district to which letter was addressed, or by its staff? Have you performed any internal inquiry as to these circumstances? And if yes, then if you could provide us with some piece of evidence, I would appreciate very much. Thank you.",
        "379": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question goes to the representative of the government. As far as I understood, your position was that before sending a letter, the applicants had to make a reasonable effort to verify the rest of the allegations. Could you please specify what could have been that reasonable effort to be satisfactory and how it could have been made? Thank you.",
        "380": "I have a small factual question to the applicants. Did you qualify your letter as confidential, either, for example, on the envelope or in the heading of the letter, so that the addressee were fully aware that the content was confidential? Thank you.",
        "381": "Thank you very much, Madam President. I have two questions. One is more of a technical clarification. The second relates to the application of legal principles. Mr. Eadie makes references on a number of occasions to the fact that the analyst has to present or formulate a written record for the justification of the choice or use of selectors. That is also referenced in the government's pleadings at paragraph 35, where it is also elaborated. I understand the government's argument to be that that is an important part. And I used the words of Mr. Eadie just now. It's an important part of the efficacy of the oversight process by the ICC. Just a clarification, in the applicant's observations, paragraph 59, subparagraph B, the applicant claims access to content is achieved by the analyst typing a few words of justification into a dropbox on their computer. There is a reference here made to the testimony of a Mr. Eric King. You will see this in the core bundle, item number five. Can I ask if the government is able to comment on this allegation made by the applicant, because it goes to the efficacy of the issue in question? My second question relates to, and it is prompted by an argument made by Mr. Jaffey this morning in relation to EU law. Mr. Jaffey mentioned how the UK government is reacting to the Digital Rights Ireland, TELETU judgments of the ECJ. May I ask the government to comment, and I would also ask the applicant to comment, to what extent does or do these judgments of the ECJ, the line of case law pronounced by the ECJ, of course, in the environment of the retention directive vis-a-vis private communications providers and its requirement? And I refer here in particular to paragraphs 119 and 120 of the TELETU judgment, where prior control is considered to be a requirement, either a judicial prior control or independent administrative control. And there is a reference made there to our judgment in SABO and VC. And I would like both parties to clarify this. To what extent is this relevant for us? And if you do not think it's relevant, and I particularly to the government, could you explain why you consider that this line of case law is not something that the court should look at when confronted with the applicant's argument, their core argument, that one of the updating requirements is prior authorization? Thank you very much.",
        "382": "Thank you, Madam President. I have three short questions. The first two directed to the respondent government, but of course the applicants may wish to wade in. And the third question directed to both. And I apologize up front if the answer to these questions is tugged away somewhere in the voluminous documentation in this case, which I may have missed. Now, the first question is both Mr. Jaffey and Ms. Mountfield have referred to the difference between external and internal communications, and how what may apparently be an internal communication may in fact be an external communication. Now, is it, and this is a very specific question, is it the position of the respondent government that such external communications deserve somehow lesser protection under the convention, under the European Convention, than internal communications? That is my question. The second question is, well, Sir James Eadie has rightly referred to the security threats and the need to secure the lives and safety of the public. Now, my question is this. What is the purpose of intelligence collection for the so-called economic well-being of the nation? How is this quote unquote economic well-being of the nation defined or interpreted in practice, also in light of what the Venice Commission refers to as economic espionage? And the third question directed to both is, what really is the rationale of the introduction by virtue of the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 of the notification of the person or persons being surveyed in cases of serious error? Is there a link between such a notification or the requirement of such a notification and the requirement of efectiveness of this 2016 act? Thank you, Madame President.",
        "383": "Thank you, Madam President. I have one question for the applicants and two more technical questions for the government. The applicant has been arguing in both their submissions in writing and today that we should use the reasonable suspicion standard as a basis for allowing bulk interception. Reasonable suspicion, however, is intrinsically linked to the concept of a crime. Bulk interception, on the other hand, is also a tool for intelligence gathering that implies more general national security risks. How does the applicant suggest that we use reasonable suspicion in this foreign intelligence context? And how would that differ from the standard applied by the government at present, which is necessary and proportionate for avoiding national security risks? My questions to the government. We understand from the government submissions that the Secretary of State warrant does indicate the content that has to be intercepted. The applicant has, in their pleadings, claimed that the warrant of the Secretary of State, however, does not specify the bearer to be intercepted. Would you agree with that description? Is it correct? And if yes, what is the process of selecting the individual bearers for interception? And my second question to the government is related to the intelligence sharing. Do I understand correct that as the warrant of the Secretary of State does not specify individuals, whenever a request is made that uses strong selectors indicating an individual, that would be included in a certificate that is being issued? Thank you.",
        "384": "Thank you. I have two questions for the government, but the applicant may feel free to comment as well. The first relates to the data retention periods. Now, we've heard today, and I think from the submissions as well, there's conflicting claims. The applicant, the counsel for the applicants said today that the agencies, they keep old data for up to two years. I think Mr. Eadie referred to several months, and the submissions talk about exceptions. So they talk about several weeks in some cases, several months, up to two years, but in all instances, there seem to be exceptions that would allow for even longer retention periods. So this is the first part of the question, and the second part is not so much as a matter of law, what the law allows, but as a matter of practice and the scope of this retention. Do UK agencies retain for considerable periods, by which I mean more than a few days or a few weeks, communications pertaining at any given time to large numbers of individuals, by which I mean in the scale of millions? So communications held of large numbers of individuals for considerable amounts of time, what is the scale, and by communications, I mean both content and communications data or metadata, and if you could factor into that response the intelligence received through sharing by third parties. And I'd appreciate if you're not in a position today to provide a response if you'd be willing to provide that in writing to the court. My second question is, as a matter of convention law, how in the view of the government is bulk surveillance involving the use of strong selectors, such as an individual's known or suspected email address or telephone number, how is that different as a matter of convention law from targeted surveillance of the same individual, let's say old-fashioned telephone tapping for purposes of reasonable suspicion, if the court found that to be applicable? I note here that your system applies both to foreign intelligence, but also to purposes of serious crime and also possibly prior judicial or some other prior form of authorization. Thank you.",
        "385": "I have some questions to the parties. Both parties can intervene. In Liberty, the court stated, and I'm quoting the court, that it does not consider that there is any ground to apply different principles concerning the accessibility and clarity of the rules governing the interception of individual communications on the one end and more general programs of surveillance on the other. This is Liberty, paragraph 63. My question to the government and to the parties is this one. Is the government proposing to depart from Liberty from this principle? In Zakharov and in Sz\u00e1bo, this principle was confirmed. In fact, in Sz\u00e1bo, in Zakharov, the criteria, the Weber criteria, were restated. And my question is, from the perspective of the government and, again, the applicants, do the Zakharov criteria, paragraph 231, apply to both surveillance? This is, for instance, the position of the French government in this case, as third party. My second question is related to the changes in the investigatory power set, 2016. What was the rationale behind the introduction of the ex ante judicial authorization in this act of 2016? Is there any reason not to trust the Secretary of State or to trust more the judges in terms of ex ante control of the proportionality of this interference? The third question relates to the legal status of the interception of communications commissioner. Is he not appointed and freely dismissed by the prime minister? Is this a part time job for the commissioner? Who provides for his staff, for the staff of the commissioner? The fourth question relates to the intelligence sharing. In the framework of intelligence sharing with non-council of Europe states, is there a legal obligation to check whether the foreign data recipient or data sender offers minimum safeguards equivalent to those of the convention? I note this, and this is a question that is related, of course, to the conclusion of the Intelligence and Security Committee of the Parliament, of Parliament, which has concluded in its 2016 report that there was a legal vacuum in this regard. So I would like you to comment on this. And final question, is there a legal obligation and final question, if this court, the European Court of Human Rights, sends a confidential message to a lawyer in London, can the respondent government guarantee that it would not be caught, our message from this court to a lawyer in London would not be caught and examined by the British intelligence? And this assuming that, of course, this message is strictly confidential. It's between the court and the lawyer in London. Thank you very much.",
        "386": "Thank you very much, Madam President. One, I have two or three questions. One is a question of clarification. Mr. Jaffey referred to the Human Rights Watch judgment of the IPT, which, as I understood him, is suggested to have tightened access to that tribunal. Can I just clarify whether he's referring to the 2016 Human Rights Watch judgment in which it was dealing with, I think, 660 applications? The second question related to that is, and it also relates to the question posed by my colleague, Judge De Gaetano, is, if I recall rightly, in that judgment, the tribunal was confronted with the question of whether applicants who were located outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United Kingdom were in fact within its jurisdiction for the purposes of its Human Rights Act jurisdiction. Now, I appreciate in this case, the government hasn't raised territorial jurisdiction. The chamber assumed it. But as we're in the Grand Chamber and we're invited to consider the scheme afresh, I wonder whether both parties could reflect on the question whether, in fact, our approach in the Bletchley judgment, where we said that the scope of the court's jurisdiction is determined by the convention and not by the party's submissions in a particular case, and the mere absence of a plea of incompatibility cannot extend jurisdiction, whether that means that, in fact, there is an issue here about jurisdiction which the court should concern itself with, whether, one, by way of admissibility, or two, and this reflects the question of my colleague, Judge De Gaetano, whether, in fact, the focus of our analysis needs to be in relation to those who are within the jurisdiction, and external communication insofar as it concerns those who are outside the jurisdiction is not within the scope of the case before us. And the third question, again, equally going to principle, is, of course, our case law so far has largely focused on the question of this issue, interception in the context of the right to respect for private life under Article 8, but, of course, a large number of the applicants are, in fact, corporate bodies, and I don't mean corporate in the commercial sense, but corporate in the non-natural person sense, and I would therefore ask both parties to reflect on the question whether, in fact, those applicants can have a right to respect for private life, and if they cannot, whether this falls, for example, under the heading of correspondence, and if so, whether the same tests apply. Thank you very much.",
        "387": "Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me first ask whether acting through the companies was ever considered seriously by the shareholders, and if so, why it was discarded. That would be my first question. My second question concerns the imperatives for the legislative reform that took place that has been described. Now, we have been informed of events taking place in Hungary and a national interest in the reform, but we have also had references to EU legislation making requirements on the legislation. Could you please elaborate upon the proportions of these two imperatives? To what extent was this defending a national interest? To what extent was it EU compliance? Thank you.",
        "388": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions, one for the applicant and second for the government. The first question for applicant, in your application, you complained about the violation of your rights under Article 1, Protocol Number 1, as shareholders of \u201cKinizsi\u201d Bank and \u201cMoh\u00e1csi\u201d Bank, but not as representatives of your banks. Is it correct? I'm asking it because formally, the decision to remain in the new scheme was the decision was made by the banks. And it is necessary to make distinction between the bank as a legal entity and shareholders of this bank. Second question to the government, you mentioned in your communication that the cooperative credit institutions had a choice to remain in the new scheme, new system, or to leave it, to exit the system. The applicant contested it because the exit was not realistic. And my question is, how realistic was the option of exit? And do you have information about the banks who did apply this right to exit from the new scheme? Thank you.",
        "389": "Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I would like to ask the applicants to clarify their victim status, because they did not raise this issue. And the second question is to the government. The question is very simple. Whether the government apply the Basel principles of the prudential supervision. And if yes, and I think that the government surely apply this principle, because they're very recognized and known principles. Do these principles include the corporate control over the financial institutions? And if not, why the government choose to go further and to have this control in addition to these principles and requirements for the capital of the financial institutions? Thank you.",
        "390": "Thank you. I have a question for the applicant, but the government, of course, may feel welcome to comment as well. My question relates to one of your submissions with respect to when you discovered the possibility of the banks themselves as corporate entities bringing this case, you argued that they were under various forms of pressure and specifically that there was pressure exerted on them after their filing a petition with the Constitutional Court of Hungary. And so I'd be grateful if you could elaborate a little bit on that, on the specifics of what happened after the filing of the petition with the Constitutional Court. Thank you.",
        "391": "Thank you, Madam President. I have one question. It is addressed to the government, and it concerns the applicability of Article 4. The government is, in their observations, recognizing that human trafficking, as well as forced prostitution, fall under Article 4, and that in such cases, the state has positive and procedural obligations. That is how I understand the government's position. But then, in the specific case, the government is arguing that Article 4, in the specific circumstance of this case, is not applicable. And in doing so, the government is relying on the outcome of the criminal proceedings, saying that after the assessment of all the evidence, the domestic courts reached the conclusion that there was no exploitation, force, abuse. Therefore, Article 4 is not applicable. That seems to be the logic. But my question, then, to the government is, can the applicability of Article 4 depend upon the outcome of the domestic proceedings, or does it rather depend upon the allegations made by the applicant or the victim when he or she comes to domestic authorities? In other words, in the view of the government, if we were to rely upon the allegations or the complaint made by the applicant to the domestic authorities, would Article 4 then be applicable, or to put it in another word, would there at least be an arguable complaint that this would fall in within the ambit of Article 4? Thank you.",
        "392": "You have mentioned that in Croatia, 170 judges have gone through education. I'm interested whether you have the information whether the particular judges and particular prosecutors and policemen who were involved in this case went through education prior working on this case. Thank you.",
        "393": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to ask one small question to the applicant and later another to the government. To the applicant, just to show or to demonstrate that there is a forced prostitution, because we know, as the government said, that prostitution itself is not prohibited. But we are talking about forced prostitution. Then in her observations, the applicant, she said that she did not want to take proactive actions because of the fear she felt. My question is, could you please explain in which manner she has received these threats from TM? And also, if she could offer proofs of it or not of these threats? And to the government, only a very concrete question, why during the process the national authorities not call more to more witnesses? Or for instance, the applicant has shown that there were other groups like whip-ons or condoms in the possession of TM. And why in the court, domestic courts, they don't use it as proof or evidences? That is my question. Thank you.",
        "394": "Thank you very much. In her application form, the applicant referred to the fact that she had been recognized as a victim of human trafficking. And during the course of proceedings, significance was attached to this recognition by the applicant in the chamber judgment and today by the applicant's representative. And I would like to ask both parties to address this issue, address it from a factual point of view, explaining to us the procedure which took place in Croatia and from a legal point of view. I'll start with the legal aspect. In paragraph 115 of J and others against Austria, the court said that it does not consider that the elements of the offense of human trafficking had been fulfilled merely because the Austrian authorities treated the applicants as potential victims of human trafficking. Such special treatment did not presuppose official confirmation that the offense had been established and was independent of the authorities' duty to investigate. Indeed potential victims need support even before the offense of human trafficking is formally established. Otherwise this would run counter to the purpose of victim protection. And of course, with a criminal trial pending, questions of presumption of innocence arise. So I would like both parties to address the significance that can or cannot be attached to recognition by an administrative authority of the status of human trafficking in this case. The factual aspect of my question relates to the case itself. As far as I understand, this victim status is recognized by the Minister of the Interior or by an operative team of the National Board for the Suppression of Human Trafficking. As far as the information that I have available, this is a multidisciplinary body. So it has representatives of the State Attorney's Office and the police, if I'm not mistaken, but please clarify that if possible. And on what basis does this body take its decision? At whose initiative? Is this on the basis of information passed by the police, the investigating authority, to the specialized body, or is it not? But we need some clarification on this question. And crucially in this case, I'd like you to address a temporal issue. The applicant brought her complaint in September. TM was questioned, the applicant was questioned, and the other key witness, MI, was questioned. The indictment was laid on the 6th of November, 2012. But the victim status was recognized only on the 21st of December. So are we looking at a situation here that the investigating authorities acted too quickly? Because they investigated her allegations brought to them in the police station, and they laid down the indictment before she was recognized as having this status of a potential victim of human trafficking? Or what actually is the significance of this recognition in a case such as this and in this particular case? And I'd like both parties to answer these questions.",
        "395": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question au gouvernement belge. Dans le paragraphe 11 des observations du gouvernement, il est mentionn\u00e9 qu'en Belgique, le scrutin est encadr\u00e9 par une l\u00e9gislation pr\u00e9cise laquelle est conforme aux recommandations de la Commission du Venice. Et la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, en ce sens, est faite au point 30.2 du code des bons conduites en mati\u00e8re \u00e9lectorale \u00e9labor\u00e9 par cette commission. A cet \u00e9gard, je voudrais conna\u00eetre le point de vue du gouvernement concernant les exigences mentionn\u00e9es au point 3.3 du m\u00eame code, selon laquel l'instance de recours en mati\u00e8re \u00e9lectorale, je cite, doit \u00eatre soit une commission \u00e9lectorale, soit un tribunal. Un recours devant le Parlement peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9vu en derni\u00e8re instance en ce qui concerne les \u00e9lections du Parlement. Dans tous les cas, un recours devant un tribunal doit \u00eatre possible en derni\u00e8re instance. Vous pouvez trouver la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette norme \u00e0 la page 7 de l'avis de la Commission du Venice dans la ferme d'aujourd'hui. Merci.",
        "396": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to thank both parties for invoking Montesquieu in their pleadings. It has created an unusual philosophical flair to this hearing. I'm not going to ask a question on Montesquieu, however. One question that I want to pose is basically an informative question about Belgian constitutional doctrine. To what extent is it understood that Parliament, either at the federal level or at the regional level, is itself entitled, when it decides on the procedures for the verification of credentials, to create an internal system which, for example, would require a supermajority of parliamentarians to decide, or even the inverse, that the commission, in this case the Commission on Verification, would itself have binding decision-making authority? So could Parliament itself internally delegate the decision on validation to a small group chosen in particular on the basis of certain formal criteria so as to minimize the risk of impartiality, excluding certain parliamentarians from certain constituencies which would be implicated by, or would that kind of internal procedure not be in conformity with the Constitution, with Article 48 or the special laws as they are now formed? I have a second question, if I may, to the applicants. The applicants' core argument, as I understand it is, Article 3 of Protocol 1 in principle excludes that Parliament itself validates credentials. There must be an external remedy. And I understood your argument, the core argument to be that this remedy should necessarily be judicial. You may correct me if I'm wrong. So I want you in that respect, and the government may also comment on this, none of the pleadings in this case bring forward an issue which I want to ask you about. Ever since 1997, this Court has said the right to stand for elections is a political right. Therefore a parliamentarian does not have a right to access a court under Article 6. There is a particular reason for that. May I ask you, is it then the argument of the applicants that although the Court has excluded judicial review under Article 6, which is the actual provision on right of access to court, that the Court can in any event interpret into Article 3 of Protocol 1 that same right to access a court or have access to a court, to invoke the same political right, which the Court has considered not to allow or permit or access courts under Article 6? Could I ask you just to comment a bit on this interplay and how you see that playing out in a case like this? Thank you very much.",
        "397": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je remercie beaucoup les deux parties pour leur intervention. J'ai une question r\u00e9currente, mais le gouvernement aussi peut commenter. J'ai deux ou trois questions, en fait. La premi\u00e8re question vise le moment o\u00f9 vous \u00e9tiez choisi en tant qu'avocat par les partis devant la haute cour de cassation et justice. En ce moment-l\u00e0, comme vous le dites vous-m\u00eame, vous savez que vous n'avez pas le certificat ORNISS . Comme vous le dites vous-m\u00eame, vous pensez que demander un certificat ORNISS  sera compliqu\u00e9, \u00e7a va d\u00e9terminer des ajournements, m\u00eame si le gouvernement a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des arr\u00eats o\u00f9 la cour a donn\u00e9 cet ajournement. Mais en m\u00eame temps, vous savez qu'il y a des avocats qui ont le certificat ORNISS. Parce que m\u00eame si ces avocats ne sont pas list\u00e9s pour des consid\u00e9rations que le baron aussi encourage de mani\u00e8re sur Internet ou sur d'autres sources, vous connaissez vous-m\u00eame en tant qu'avocat, ou vous pouvez demander en tant qu'avocat, qui sont les avocats avec le certificat ORNISS. Et ma question \u00e9tait la suivante. Pourquoi est-ce qu'au moment o\u00f9 vous vous \u00e9tiez nomm\u00e9 et que vous \u00e9tiez conscient que vous n'aviez pas acc\u00e8s aux informations vu que vous n'avez pas le certificat ORNISS, vous n'avez pas demand\u00e9 un ajournement pour demander \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue qui a un certificat ORNISS de se pr\u00e9senter dans ce cas et d'avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces informations? Deuxi\u00e8me question que je vais mettre. Votre coll\u00e8gue, ma\u00eetre Dumitru, a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un certain moment \u00e0 une tendance claire. Elle dit une tendance claire dans les normes europ\u00e9ennes. Et ma question, elle est un peu plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale parce que parfois on utilise tendance claire, parfois on parle de consensus europ\u00e9en. Qu'est-ce que vous pensez de cet \u00e9quilibre qui est requis par l'article 1, par le paragraphe 7, au moment 2012 au niveau des normes europ\u00e9ennes, ce qu'on appelle, nous, le consensus europ\u00e9en? Quelles \u00e9taient les demandes qui, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, on faisait au gouvernement et o\u00f9 est-ce que le gouvernement et les instances se trouvaient de point de vue du garantie qui sont requises, comme vous dites, dans l'article 1, par le paragraphe 7? Et \u00e7a, c'est aussi une question que j'adresse au gouvernement. Une troisi\u00e8me question vise le rapport que vous avez ici invoqu\u00e9 entre l'article 11 et l'article 20 de la Constitution en disant que, finalement, les instances internes n'ont pas respect\u00e9 l'article 20 de la Constitution. Est-ce qu'il y avait un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dans la Cour qui pouvait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0? Comment est-ce que vous appr\u00e9ciez, et \u00e7a c'est aux deux parties, le cas Regner par rapport \u00e0 ce cas? Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "398": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai 2 questions. Mon 1re question est direct\u00e9e au gouvernement. Juste pour avoir une certaine clarit\u00e9 en ce qui concerne les faits. Je comprends le dossier d'une fa\u00e7on suivante. Alors, on a cette communiqu\u00e9e de presse qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2012. Devant la haute cour de cassation, est-ce que cette communiqu\u00e9e de presse a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e formellement par le procureur? Ca veut dire que \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 comme un document formel devant la proc\u00e9dure de la haute cour de cassation. Et j'invite les Mme Les ma\u00eeres aussi de donner une r\u00e9ponse, si vous avez une r\u00e9ponse. Ma 2e question est li\u00e9e... Ou le 1er est direct\u00e9e aux Mmes et les ma\u00eetres. Est-ce que vous pensez que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contenus dans la communiqu\u00e9e de presse, si on imagine que l'information factuelle dans la communiqu\u00e9e de presse a \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement dans le document de procureur soumis \u00e0 la cour d'appel, est-ce que vous pensez que \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisantes?",
        "399": "Thank you, Mr. President. Well, first, I have some questions for the government and later for the applicants. Then, related to the government, my question is related to the facts and proofs. Did the Court of Appeal provide the applicants with sufficient factual information of the accusations against them, or what minimum information? Or the only information they have is through this communique of press? My question is very concrete. Then, going to the proofs in order to have a guarantee in the process, what kind of proof, maybe even if they are top secret or confidential, but are there some proofs about that the applicants, the two applicants supported a fundamental Islamic group linked to an ideologically Al-Qaeda group? And now, my questions for the lawyers of the applicants. They are also related to facts related to the curriculum, I would say, or the profile of the two applicants. We have received the information that now the first applicant, Mr. Adeel Muhammad, is now living in Dubai in United Arab Emirates. I want to know if it is like that. And if it is possible to know what he's now doing, studying, or they are working, or why he has not come back to Pakistan, well, if it is possible to have some information. And also, in relation with the two applicants, well, we know in the file that there were two of them in Romania with a student's visa, the Erasmus Mundus with an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. Then, I don't know if it is possible to know, but I see that they have met in their university in Romania. But I don't know if they know each other before or not, if we have this data. Only that. Thank you very much.",
        "400": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Sur une question au gouvernement qui est li\u00e9e \u00e0 la question de mon coll\u00e8gue, juge Spano, et qui concerne le communiqu\u00e9 de presse. On comprend qu'il n'y avait plus d'informations donn\u00e9es au public g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu'aux recoeurants pendant la proc\u00e9dure. Et je m'int\u00e9resserais de savoir pourquoi. Est-ce que c'\u00e9tait intentionnel ou non? Est-ce qu'il y avait une certaine coordination entre le service de presse et le parquet? Et ma deuxi\u00e8me question, c'est comment se d\u00e9roule-t-il un proc\u00e8s s'il y a un avocat qui a un certificat ORNISS? Alors, est-ce qu'un tel avocat peut plaider librement, bas\u00e9 sur les informations qu'il aurait dans ces circonstances? Et \u00e0 ce moment, est-ce que les recoeurants seraient exclus? Est-ce que ce serait un proc\u00e8s \u00e0 huis clos? Merci beaucoup.",
        "401": "Thank you, President. My first question is a kind of continuation of the question by my colleague Judge Motac because it appears that the parties disagree on interpretation of legislation. The government in their presentation mentioned a recent case before High Court of Justice where the hearing were adjourned, as you said, twice in order to allow a lawyer to obtain ORNISS certificate. At the same time, Article 86 of Emergency Ordinance 194 of 2002 is very clear. The High Court gives a decision within five days from the date when the appeal is deposited. And that is something the applicants argued because apparently to obtain the ORNISS certificate at least 30 days are necessary, if I understand correctly. So my question is, can still the High Court circumvent the strict term of five days provided for in Article 86? And my second very exact factual question is to the applicants. At which exact moment the applicants were explained their defense rights, including a necessity to have a lawyer with ORNISS certificate? Thank you.",
        "402": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for the government. There are certain elements in our file that indicate that in support of his application, the prosecutor filed documents, in plural, describing relevant activities of the applicants. However, according to some other information in our file, the prosecutor filed one single document, un\u00e9crit, in this respect. So I would kindly ask you to clarify on this particular point. My second question is connected, to a certain extent, to my first question, namely whether in addition to or apart from describing activities of the applicants, alleged activities of the applicants, the document or the documents contained anything else apart from the description of their activities. Thank you.",
        "403": "Thank you. I would like to pose two questions to the government primarily. The first one relates also to the press release which was already raised by my colleagues. I would like to know on what basis it was lawful or considered lawful and justified to provide more details to the general public than to the applicants. And the second question has to do with the time frame of the proceedings. I understand that the request from the SRE was filed on the 4th of December. The prosecutor's application to the Court of Appeal was made the same day and the applicants were summoned in the evening of that day to appear at a hearing the following morning and the judgment was given that same day. So the time frame was very accelerated it seems. Is this usual practice or was it because of reasons related to this case? So why this accelerated time frame?",
        "404": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Donc, j'ai une question \u00e0 poser au r\u00e9current. Vous avez dit que finalement, ces avocats qui ont le certificat hors Nice ne sont pas sur une liste publique \u00e0 cause de la concurrence. \u00c7a, on le conna\u00eet bien. Mais est-ce que vous avez des preuves \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9crites que vous avez demand\u00e9 au barreau qu'il vous\u2026 que vous avez une aide de la part d'un avocat avec un certificat hors Nice? \u00c7a, c'est ma question. Parce que \u00e7a, on arrive un peu \u00e0 une conclusion ad absurde. \u00c7a veut dire que ces avocats qui ont le certificat hors Nice, ils ne sont pas connus publiquement \u00e0 cause de leur liste, mais aussi, ils ne peuvent pas \u00eatre connus par des gens qui adressent le bureau, le barreau des avocats. Donc, \u00e0 ma connaissance, le barreau des avocats, il a le devoir de communiquer le nom de ces personnes. Sinon, \u00e7a veut dire que ces avocats ne trouvent pas aucune place dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. \u00c7a, c'est ma premi\u00e8re question. Si vous avez quelque chose d'\u00e9crit que le barreau vous a refus\u00e9 dans ce respect. Deuxi\u00e8me question, dans ce qui est une question de suivi \u00e0 ce que mes coll\u00e8gues le juge Spano et la juge Nussberger avaient mis. Devant la haute cour de justice et de cassation, le office rouman pour immigration, il a demand\u00e9 que votre question soit rejet\u00e9e vu qu'ils ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 cette question. Le litige porte \u00e0 l'objet la saisine faite par la cour d'appel de Bucarest et que r\u00e9levant sont les inscrits et pas ce qui est ressorti du communiqu\u00e9 de presse du service rouman de l'information. Et \u00e7a, c'est \u00e0 mon avis ce que c'est retenu. Si vous pensez que finalement, \u00e7a c'\u00e9tait ce que c'est retenu dans la d\u00e9cision de la haute cour de cassation et que finalement, la base \u00e9tait les informations secr\u00e8tes et pas ce qui est ressorti du communiqu\u00e9 de presse. Troisi\u00e8me chose, vous avez affirm\u00e9 que le service rouman de l'information proc\u00e8de par ses communiqu\u00e9s de presse \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, mais moi, je n'ai pas vu au dossier les preuves dans ce sens. J'ai vu seulement des d\u00e9cisions des hautes cours qui vont dans notre direction, mais je ne connais pas d'apr\u00e8s les preuves que vous avez mises \u00e0 dossier une pratique constante du service d'information rouman dans ce sens. Merci beaucoup.",
        "405": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai deux questions adress\u00e9es aux deux partis et qui se focalisent notamment sur l'article 7 de la Convention. En ce qui int\u00e9resse, la premi\u00e8re, la voil\u00e0. Le fait que l'article 223 du Code de proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale ne pr\u00e9voit aucune limite \u00e0 l'amende impos\u00e9e, peut-il poser un probl\u00e8me au titre du principe fondamental de l'\u00e9tat de droit, notamment celui de la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs? Et en ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me question, c'est la suivante. En mati\u00e8re purement p\u00e9nale, est-ce que les peines, qu'il s'agisse de prison ou d'amende, sont-elles fix\u00e9es clairement dans la loi islandaise au titre de la jurisprudence de la Grande Chambre \u00e9tablie dans Del R\u00edo Prada? Je vous remercie, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "406": "Thank you very much. I would just have a question concerning the foreseeability of the sanction. And I wanted to know, is this fine or what is fine fix in relation to the potential gain of the lawyers in the case or in relation to the real gain? Or in relation to other factors? I understand that you mentioned also the complexity of the case or perhaps also the potential damages caused by the delay. In which relation was the sanction fixed? Thank you.",
        "407": "Thank you. I have a question for the applicant with respect to the third angle criterion. Now, if I understood correctly, your submission today was that in terms of the severity of the fine, the fact that it is unlimited in theory is sufficient to bring the criminal limbo of Article VI into play. And my question there is that our case law tends to judge the severity of a sanction based on the actual fine, not the theoretical possibility of a fine. And secondly, if you could address the government's submission that in at least some similar cases, with respect to the actual fine applied in this case, the court has found that even higher amounts do not necessarily or automatically trigger the criminal limbo of Article VI. Thank you. And of course, the government, if they wish to comment, might do so.",
        "408": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a follow-up question to the question which were already posed by the colleagues Pastor Vilanova and Nu\u00dfberger. It concerns Article 7. One of the complaints by the applicants was that the amount of the fine imposed had not been foreseeable, as no maximum amount was stipulated in domestic law, moderate and statute law, or case law. As you know, in many European countries, maximum penalties are set in law as a guarantee against arbitrary punishment. And making it foreseeable that punishment will never exceed that maximum. Iceland being a country not having set such limits in law, my question is, what are the procedural safeguards in place in Iceland against arbitrary punishment? Thank you.",
        "409": "I have a question on Article 6 first. On Article 6, I have a question whether under the domestic criminal procedure, there are any regulations that are defining trial in absentia. So how you have to act when there was a trial in absentia. Do you have any provisions regulating that? Then we have heard something of that, but I would like to be explained when and in which way the applicants became aware that contempt proceedings have been instituted against them. At which point and how they became aware of that. And then for the Article 7, how is fine defined in criminal code itself? So are there limits to the fines in criminal code, offenses that are defined in criminal code, and the fine is envisaged for the offense? Is that fine defined in criminal code? And the fine is envisaged for the offense. Is that fine limited? Is there the maximum? Thank you.",
        "410": "You have said that you have, in rare cases, example, you have given bankruptcy cases, these special provisions in absentia. So what these special provisions in absentia, what special guarantee they entail?",
        "411": "This is a discretion of the government because the government said that there are sometimes special provisions for the trials in absentia. So what that could be then?",
        "412": "Thank you very much, Madam President. I would like to pose a question for clarification, mainly to the government, but I would, of course, invite the applicants to comment as well, if they so wish. The chamber in this case, at the end of paragraph 139, said as follows, judicial supervision performed by the Foreign Intelligence Court is of crucial importance in that it limits the FRA's discretion by interpreting the scope of mandating and performing signals intelligence. The applicants, of course, accept that the review process is important, but they claim before this court that it is, in any event, ineffective. And they make arguments in support of that claim. At paragraph 96 of the government's observations, it is stated that the FRA must submit an application for a permit in respect of each signal's intelligence mission. And in its applications, the FRA must specify not only the collection assignment in question and the intelligence requirements, but also the signal carriers to which access is requested and the selectors, or at least the categories of selectors that will be used. My clarification is as follows. The judicial permit procedure, these are the words used by Mrs. Hammarskj\u00f6ld, this is a process of judicial permission at the outset, at the beginning of the process. And I want you to correct me in your answer if I'm explaining this or understanding this incorrectly. The FRA submits a request. And in this request, you have these elements, but set forth in a rather generic manner. For example, the types of selectors. In other words, we will be using, for example, emails or communications type data, date and time, and so forth. Subsequently, there is access to the data. The logs are generated. The analyst uses search terms. That part of the process is not in any shape or form subject to judicial control. That is after the Foreign Intelligence Court has come into play. But it is, according to your submissions, subject to the ex post oversight of the inspectorate. Am I understanding, in general, the way this works? So the judicial warrant or the judicial permit procedure is simply a general request explicating, in general terms, what the mission is and what kinds of selectors are used. Thank you very much.",
        "413": "Thank you. I have one question. Could you explain what is, pressure for the government, what is external communication for the purposes of collection of intelligence data? And could you explain to me, is it, for example, Facebook communication or Instagram communication between two person in Sweden considered as external communication for the purposes of the law? And if yes, does it mean that the position of the government is that external communication deserve less protection than internal communication? Thank you.",
        "414": "Thank you. Basically, I'm posing some of the questions that I raised this morning to both parties. One of the questions, essential questions, are is the one relating to the criteria that the court has used in other similar cases. And the position of the applicants is that the applicable criteria in this case is Zakharov. Zakharov, and we should stick to Zakharov because it's a bulk interception case. This is the position of the applicants both this morning and this afternoon. This morning, the government replied saying, yes, Zakharov applies to bulk interception, bulk surveillance. So my question is, what is the position of the respondent government? Is Zakharov the authority in this field of law? Does it apply to bulk surveillance or not? And the criteria, the relevant criteria, you are aware, of course, of it. It's paragraph 230 and 231 of Zakharov. And with this in mind, I would make a specific question to the applicants. Because the applicants say in their submissions that, and I'm quoting the applicants, in cases where there are no defined targets at the initial point of data collection, the authorizing body must nevertheless be required to meet a similar materiality or relevant threshold to use personal data as selectors. So it's no longer reasonable suspicion. It's the relevant threshold. Could you elaborate on this? What is this? What is this, the relevance threshold? Are you not departing from Zakharov, from your initial position of principle? And this leads me to the second question, which is related to the separation, clear cut separation in Swedish law between criminal investigation and data collection for national security purposes. My question is the following. This is clear. It results from the law. But the fact is that since 2013, police and army have direct access to the FRA's database. And in the near future, they can even have access in relation to events that are under ongoing criminal investigation. And the question is this. Are we not going into a slippery slope where gradually this instrument, which is basically an instrument of intelligence gathering, becoming effectively a domestic instrument of criminal investigation? Third question is related to the status of the Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate. It is composed of two former judges and four former politicians appointed by government, appointed and dismissed freely by government. Is this a part-time job? Is this, are these people supported by sufficient staff? How do they work in terms of the means, the material, and human means available to them? So I would like you to elaborate on the status of this Foreign Intelligence Inspectorate. And this having in mind the criticism addressed by the Venice Commission report, paragraph 120 and 121, to the Swedish model. Final question. The United Nations Human Rights Committee report 2016 on Sweden reproached the Swedish intelligence gathering system. My question is the following. Has the government acted upon the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Committee? What was the reaction, the follow-up, given to this report of the United Nations Human Rights Committee 2016? Ultimately, the question is the same put today to during the morning. Is there a legal obligation in Swedish law to check whether foreign data recipients and data senders from non-council of Europe states to offer minimum safeguards equivalent to those of the convention? Thank you very much.",
        "415": "Thank you so much, Mr. President. I have just three questions. First of all, I'm coming back on a subject touched in the hearing, just to resume definitively. It appears from the party's submission that they disagree on a factual aspect of the case. According to the applicant in paragraph 144 of its observation, following and after the lifting of the parliamentary immunities, no criminal investigation was initiated against the deputy belonging to the AKP or to the MHP, although the parliamentary immunities were also listed. The government submit in paragraph 90 of its observation that five AKP deputies and one MHP deputy were also convicted or sentenced after the lifting of their parliamentary immunity. I will invite the government to clarify the court on this matter. In particular, are there any AKP and or MHP deputies who have been sentenced after the lifting of their parliamentary immunity? Where appropriate, the applicant may also answer this question. Second, the judgment issued by the chamber exactly at paragraph 275 has established that due to the conclusion already reached, it is not necessary to pronounce specifically on the alleged violation of Article 10, either from the point of view of admissibility or from that of the ground. I would like to know from both parties what their opinion is in this respect, having regard to the court's jurisprudence on this subject. Third, in the Turkish legal system, is it possible for a deputy placed in pretrial detention to propose drafting law? Where appropriate, the parties are invited to produce relevant legislation in this area. Thank you so much.",
        "416": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions, and the first is directed to both parties. The second is directed to the applicant. So, the applicant's lawyers have submitted to the court a document issued on 11th of December, 2018, according to which the applicant started to serve his sentence of four years and eight months as of 7th of September, 2018. So, in light of this evidence, as of this date, can the applicant still be considered in pretrial detention or in detention because of his conviction and be deprived of his liberty for the purposes of Article 5.1A of the Convention? And my second question is directed to the applicant. In your observations, you pointed out in particular that Turkish law did not allow detained members of Parliament to vote by proxy, since they are required to be physically present in order to vote. So, in this respect, I wonder if you are aware of any European state that allows a detained member of Parliament to vote by proxy. I ask, as it may be relevant if the court were to determine the existence of a European consensus on this issue. Thank you.",
        "417": "Thank you, President. I'm interested in the status of parliamentarians in Turkey. And so let me just quote Article 83, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution. Members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly shall not be liable for their votes and statements in the course of the Assembly's work, for the views they express before the Assembly, or unless the Assembly decides otherwise on the proposal of the Bureau for a particular sitting, for repeating or disseminating such views outside the Assembly. So this is a clear rule on parliamentary non-liability. The intention is, as stated in the judgment of the Turkish Constitutional Court of 21st March 1994, I quote, to allow those responsible for legislative duties to carry them out in the knowledge that they were safely sheltered, and rightly so, from all worry and pressure. So this was not changed. It was Article 83, Paragraph 2 that was changed, not this rule on non-liability. So my question is now how to interpret or how this rule is interpreted in Turkey. First, is there a specific procedure if statements are made outside Parliament? It's written that on the proposal of the Bureau, a decision of the Assembly for a particular sitting. So is there always a specific decision if speeches outside Parliament are not under this protection? And were there such decisions taken in the case of the applicant? And how is it interpreted to say for repeating and disseminating views outside? Must it be a literal repetition, or can it be general? How is that interpreted? And if the article talks about speeches, does it also apply to tweets or other forums in the social media? This is my first question. And my second question, I have closely followed what the government's representative said about foreseeability under Article 83.2 and the change in the Constitution. And I just want to ask, if I understand you correctly, that you don't include the aspect of procedural guarantees in foreseeability. And the last question concerns evidence. I understand that there were two criminal different crimes, membership of a terrorist organization and incitement to hatred. And on the second crime, membership of a terrorist organization, I wonder what were the concrete elements on which this suspicion was based on. The applicant argues in observations paragraph 32 that this was based only, I quote now the applicant, on the similarity of a tweet by the HDP party and a tweet by Murat Karayilan of the PKK. But this was proved to be a fake account. So I wonder, is that true? Was it really a fake account? And what were the elements the suspicion was based on? Thank you.",
        "418": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. Just one quick follow-up question, in a sense, to the questions asked by my colleague, Judge Nu\u00dfberger. She's asked a question about the relevance of the procedural guarantees before the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in relation to individual cases of the seeking and lifting of the immunity. And I would equally be interested in that. The second question for me comes from her last question about evidence in relation to membership of a terrorist organization. I'm not so much concerned about that. She's asked that question. My concern is more in terms of foreseeability. On what basis can it be said, or is it said, that the definition applied by the Turkish courts of what is a terrorist organization was, in fact, foreseeable? And what is that definition based on? And if it is based solely on national law, in how far is this court, or should this court, have regard to wider European or worldwide acceptance of that definition as a terrorist organization outside Turkey? Thank you very much.",
        "419": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions, one for applicants and one for government. The first question for applicants, the government claims that your client refused to appear before the trial court, which ordered his continued detention. If so, did the applicant's refusal contribute to the overall length of the trial detention? And my second question for government, that shortly after the declaration of the Dolmabah\u00e7e consensus, the president of Turkey, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said that it was out of the question that the government would reach an agreement with a terrorist organization. And several weeks before the parliamentary elections of 7 June 2015, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Erdo\u011fan], made the following statement to the press. If the HDB exceeds the threshold, meaning the representation in parliament, and the AKP government loses power, there will be no solution process. Does it mean that the solution process with the political opposition party was conditioned by not exceeding the threshold of representativeness? And how such statements can be interpreted within the context of free elections? Thank you.",
        "420": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais revenir un instant sur les questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es par Mme la juge Nu\u00dfberger et par M. le juge Eicke. L'immunit\u00e9 parlementaire a notamment pour but de prot\u00e9ger la libert\u00e9 d'expression renforc\u00e9e dont doivent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier les parlementaires. A ce titre-l\u00e0, il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d'une non-responsabilit\u00e9 pour les discours qu'il prononce. Lorsque n\u00e9anmoins une demande de lev\u00e9e d'immunit\u00e9 parlementaire est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il appartient \u00e0 l'Assembl\u00e9e, dont le parlementaire est membre, de v\u00e9rifier avec beaucoup d'attention qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une fa\u00e7on d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e ou directe de porter atteinte \u00e0 cette libert\u00e9 d'expression que prot\u00e8ge l'immunit\u00e9. Cet examen auquel doit proc\u00e9der l'Assembl\u00e9e \u00e0 qui une demande de lev\u00e9e d'immunit\u00e9 est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e doit \u00eatre d'autant plus attentif, me semble-t-il, lorsque cette demande d'immunit\u00e9 se rattache \u00e0 des discours prononc\u00e9s par un parlementaire. C'est bien le cas dans notre affaire o\u00f9 le requ\u00e9rant a fait l'objet d'une lev\u00e9e de son immunit\u00e9 parlementaire, principalement au titre des discours qu'il a prononc\u00e9s. Ce qui est difficile pour moi \u00e0 comprendre, et les explications donn\u00e9es par les partis me seront pr\u00e9cieuses, c'est comment cet examen vigilant, destin\u00e9 \u00e0 prononcer la n\u00e9cessaire libert\u00e9 d'expression d'un parlementaire, comment cet examen vigilant peut-il \u00eatre men\u00e9 lorsqu'il se traduit par une d\u00e9cision qui prend la forme d'un article g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la Constitution et qui s'applique sans pr\u00e9cision aucune des cas individuels \u00e0 l'ensemble des d\u00e9put\u00e9s pour lesquels une demande de lev\u00e9e d'immunit\u00e9 \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e auparavant par le gouvernement.",
        "421": "I just would like to follow up to the question of Judge Eicke, who asked to explain how the terrorist organization is understood, and this is actually a follow-up to what we have heard by the Commissioner. In terms of over-broadness and how in Turkish society and Turkish judiciary this is approached nowadays, I would just like to broaden that a little bit, and if you can also address the issue of terrorist propaganda. So not only terrorist organization, but terrorist propaganda and how is that understood. Thank you.",
        "422": "Yes, thank you very much. Indeed, I would like to have some clarification, because I understood now on my question about Article 83, Paragraph 1, that the applicants argue that it was raised both before the courts and before the Constitutional Court, and the government says it was not raised. So is there any evidence you could resort to explain that to us? My second question is, did I understand the government representative correctly that you said before the change of 83, Paragraph 2, there was a practice that individual withdrawal of immunity procedure was not used? So if there was such a practice, could parliamentarians rely on such a practice? And the third question concerns, once again, this procedural change of the procedural position in this withdrawal procedure. I want to understand, did the individual have still a right to protest against it? So did he have a right to protest against the withdrawal if being a member of the collective assessment, just in light of our Kar\u00e1csony judgment? That's what I want to mention. Thank you.",
        "423": "Yes, just a clarification question. Council for the government indicated the, I think it was a four stage test under Turkish law for assessing membership of a terrorist organization. And the first one of that understood was several acts undertaken under the instruction of the leadership of a terrorist organization. What you didn't tell us, and which would be helpful, I think, certainly to me, to understand better, is how does one know that the leadership of the organization under whose instructions one acts is, for criminal purposes in Turkey, or generally a terrorist organization? Thank you.",
        "424": "Merci, Mme la Pr\u00e9sidente. Mes premi\u00e8res questions concernent l'\u00e9puisement des voies de recours internes et s'adressent au recoeurant. Ma\u00eetre Lantheaume, le requ\u00e9rant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande d'asile le 19 mars 2018 lors de sa d\u00e9tention administrative. Y'eu \u00e9gard qui'il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait des conseils de son avocat, pourquoi n'a-t-il pas form\u00e9 une demande d'asile avant de saisir la cour? Avec sa demande de mesures provisoires? Et en plus, pourquoi le requ\u00e9rant n'a-t-il pas fait appel de l'ordonnance du juge des r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s du tribunal administratif en date du 8 mars 2018? Y'eu \u00e9gard ou d\u00e9lai qui s\u00e9parait cette date du jour de sa d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration? Et maintenant, mes questions concernent le grief tir\u00e9 de l'article 3 de la Convention. Ces questions s'adressent aux deux parties. Concernant la situation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en Alg\u00e9rie, est-ce qu'il y a des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui indiquent que des personnes li\u00e9es au terrorisme ont subi en 2017 ou en 2018 des mauvais traitements en d\u00e9tention de la part des autorit\u00e9s alg\u00e9riennes, en particulier des personnes avec lesquelles le requ\u00e9rant \u00e9tait en contact en Alg\u00e9rie au moment des faits ayant abouti sa condamnation p\u00e9nale? Et concernant les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, existent-il des raisons de penser que le recoeurant est soup\u00e7onn\u00e9 par les autorit\u00e9s alg\u00e9riennes d'infractions li\u00e9es au terrorisme en Alg\u00e9rie? Et existent-il des raisons de penser, des indices que le requ\u00e9rant est actuellement recherch\u00e9 hors proc\u00e9dure judiciaire par des services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, notamment par le DSS, la Direction des services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9? Et ma derni\u00e8re question s'adresse uniquement au gouvernement. Quelle institution ind\u00e9pendante pourrait, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, rendre visite au requ\u00e9rant s'il venait \u00e0 \u00eatre priv\u00e9 de libert\u00e9? Merci.",
        "425": "Merci beaucoup, Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente. J'ai plusieurs questions sur la r\u00e9civilit\u00e9 et aussi sur le fond. Les deux premi\u00e8res questions, ce sont pour le gouvernement, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'\u00e9puisement. Le gouvernement d\u00e9fendeur soutient-il qu'une demande d'asile, dans un cas comme celui-ci, c'est-\u00e0-dire o\u00f9 une ITF est suivie plusieurs ann\u00e9es plus tard par un arr\u00eat\u00e9 fixant le pays de destination, est la seule voie de recours effective ou s'agit-il d'une voie effective parmi d'autres? Dans ce m\u00eame contexte, une deuxi\u00e8me question pour le gouvernement, est-ce que cette r\u00e9partition de comp\u00e9tences qu'on voit dans ce dossier entre le juge judiciaire qui impose l'ITF mais ne peut pas l'examiner \u00e0 l'aune de l'article 3 de la Convention et le juge administratif qui peut entamer un tel examen, mais seulement lorsqu'une d\u00e9cision administrative fixant le pays de renvoi est prise, est-ce que cette r\u00e9partition de comp\u00e9tences ne cr\u00e9e pas un vrai imbroglio? Elle semble en pratique priver d'effets suspensifs le recours contre la d\u00e9cision fixant le pays de renvoi autrement pr\u00e9vu par l'article 513-3 du CECEDA. Bien s\u00fbr, je pose cette question en tant que juge non fran\u00e7ais. La troisi\u00e8me question visant l'\u00e9puisement et pour le r\u00e9cr\u00e9ant, mais bien s\u00fbr, les deux parties sont invit\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre s'ils veulent aux questions pos\u00e9es. Et cette question reprend un point d\u00e9j\u00e0 soul\u00e9v\u00e9 par mon coll\u00e8gue, Madame Kucsko-Stadlmayer. Ayant choisi la voie de juge administratif en l'esp\u00e8ce pour faire obstacle \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 fixant le pays de renvoi, pourquoi le requ\u00e9rant n'a-t-il pas introduit un recours contre cet refus par le juge de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer libert\u00e9 devant le Conseil d'\u00c9tat? Et, sauf erreur de ma part, le Conseil d'\u00c9tat aurait pu \u00e9galement statuer avant son renvoi programm\u00e9 en Alg\u00e9rie. J'ai deux questions sur le fond. Les deux parties sont invit\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre. Je reprends un point soul\u00e9v\u00e9 par le gouvernement d\u00e9fendeur d'abord. Le juge de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer libert\u00e9, l'OFPRA, la Cour nationale du droit d'asile, le tribunal administratif de Lille ont tous statu\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens, \u00e0 savoir en refusant les recours du requ\u00e9rant en l'absence du risque all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par lui. Alors, ma question est tr\u00e8s simple. Pourquoi la Cour devrait-elle aujourd'hui statuer autrement compte tenu des principes \u00e9tablis dans sa jurisprudence? Et je cite entre autres l'arr\u00eat Saadi, l'arr\u00eat G\u00e9quet contre Su\u00e8de, voire m\u00eame l'arr\u00eat Douadie contre France. Et j'invite les deux parties \u00e0 prendre position sur le fait qu'\u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, dans l'affaire Douadie contre France, la CN2A, sauf erreur de ma part, a bien constat\u00e9 l'existence du risque all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par le r\u00e9cr\u00e9ant. Derni\u00e8re question. Compte tenu de la puissance des moteurs de recherche comme Google aujourd'hui, quelle est la valeur lors de l'appr\u00e9ciation globale entam\u00e9e par la Cour du crit\u00e8re relatif \u00e0 la m\u00e9diatisation de la situation du r\u00e9cr\u00e9ant dont vous avez tous les deux parl\u00e9? Je vous remercie.",
        "426": "Merci, Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente. Merci aux partis qui nous ont donn\u00e9, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de leurs repr\u00e9sentants, des explications particuli\u00e8rement riches et int\u00e9ressantes qui nourriront notre d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Permettez-moi de r\u00e9agir de fa\u00e7on assez spontan\u00e9e \u00e0 certains des d\u00e9bats qui se sont exprim\u00e9s devant nous. Tout d'abord, s'agissant de la recevabilit\u00e9, je dois dire que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu surpris par les termes utilis\u00e9s par le repr\u00e9sentant du requ\u00e9rant qui qualifiait le recours \u00e0 la demande d'asile d'une conception th\u00e9orique d'un recours. Est-ce qu'on ne pourrait pas dire au contraire que, th\u00e9oriquement, ce n'est pas fait pour \u00e7a, mais qu'au fond, pratiquement, cela sert le plus souvent \u00e0 cela d'abord? Et notamment, est-ce qu'on peut consid\u00e9rer qu'il est purement th\u00e9orique de soumettre son cas \u00e0 l'OFPRA alors qu'on sait, comme l'a rappel\u00e9 le gouvernement, que l'OFPRA examine notamment le risque de violation de l'article 3 en cas de renvoi et que s'il constate, comme c'est le cas assez souvent, que ce risque existe, m\u00eame s'il ne peut accorder l'asile, le m\u00e9canisme ou l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de l'article L5132 du CEDESA emp\u00eache le renvoi de cet \u00e9tranger? De telle sorte que la question que je me pose, c'est lorsque vous qualifiez de conception th\u00e9orique le recours \u00e0 cette demande d'asile, est-ce que vous contestez cette possibilit\u00e9? Est-ce que vous estimez que, contrairement \u00e0 ce que a dit le gouvernement, soit l'OFPRA n'examine pas le danger de violation de l'article 3 lorsque ce danger est invoqu\u00e9 ou que, lorsque ce danger est constat\u00e9 par l'OFPRA, l'application de l'article 5132 n'est pas respect\u00e9e? Donc voil\u00e0 ma question. De m\u00eame que je n'ai pas exactement compris pourquoi vous consid\u00e9riez qu'il \u00e9tait inconcevable que quelqu'un qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 pour terrorisme demande \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'asile, je n'ai pas compris si c'\u00e9tait par une sorte de volont\u00e9 de coh\u00e9rence, c'est-\u00e0-dire j'ai port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 des principes fondamentaux de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au sein de ce pays et je ne peux pas, sans contradiction, lui demander de m'accorder l'asile. Je respecterais beaucoup ce sens de la coh\u00e9rence, mais je ne suis pas s\u00fbr que lorsque l'on craint d'\u00eatre menac\u00e9 de torture, le pragmatisme ne l'emporte pas sur ce souci de coh\u00e9rence. Enfin, je ne comprends pas tr\u00e8s bien pourquoi en d\u00e9tention, il serait beaucoup plus difficile de demander l'asile que de saisir la cour d'une demande de mesures provisoires fond\u00e9e sur l'article 39 de son r\u00e8glement. Lorsque l'on a un avocat averti, ne peut-il pas, dans l'un et l'autre cas, fournir les informations et l'aide n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9senter ces deux types de voies de droit? Donc, comme vous l'avez compris, cette question s'adressait essentiellement aux repr\u00e9sentants du requ\u00e9rant. Je me tourne cette fois-ci vers le gouvernement. Cette question des garanties diplomatiques a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sente dans vos expos\u00e9s l'un et l'autre, aussi bien pour le gouvernement que pour le requ\u00e9rant. Nous comprenons que, malgr\u00e9 ces efforts, le gouvernement fran\u00e7ais n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir de telles garanties du gouvernement alg\u00e9rien. \u00c7a me conduit \u00e0 deux interrogations que je vous livre. Premi\u00e8re interrogation, au fond, pourquoi? Qu'est-ce qui s'oppose \u00e0 cela, quand on y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit? J'entends bien, et \u00e7a fait partie de la position de chacun, que les repr\u00e9sentants du requ\u00e9rant sous-entendent. S'il n'y a pas de garantie, c'est parce que la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la situation ne permettrait pas de les donner, car la lutte contre le terrorisme, contre la torture, pardon, ne serait pas suffisamment r\u00e9elle, cr\u00e9dible. Mais, au fond, qu'est-ce qui s'y oppose? Je sais bien qu'il est d\u00e9licat en mati\u00e8re de diplomatie, de discerner les ressorts des d\u00e9cisions ou des refus, mais n\u00e9anmoins, il pourrait \u00eatre \u00e9clairant pour la Cour de le comprendre. Deuxi\u00e8me question, si des engagements, des garanties diplomatiques formelles, avec tout ce que cela repr\u00e9sente, sont difficiles, est-ce qu'il est envisageable, comme la Cour a pu le constater dans d'autres dossiers, que des engagements ou des accords interviennent \u00e0 des niveaux moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s que les niveaux minist\u00e9riels, dans des formes moins solennelles, mais dont la port\u00e9e pourrait \u00eatre aussi concr\u00e8te et r\u00e9elle que les engagements diplomatiques? Est-ce envisageable? Voil\u00e0 ma seconde question et je vous remercie.",
        "427": "Merci beaucoup, Madame la Pr\u00e9sidente. Il ne s'agit pas du tout de relancer le d\u00e9bat de fa\u00e7on interminable, mais simplement de revenir sur un point tr\u00e8s concret que vous venez d'\u00e9voquer. Vous avez dit, j'esp\u00e8re ne pas trahir la formulation que vous avez utilis\u00e9e, il est difficile d'apporter des preuves du risque, risque de violation de l'article 3, lorsque l'on est en d\u00e9tention. Ce que je peux comprendre, il est plus difficile, en effet. On a moins d'acc\u00e8s ext\u00e9rieur. Est-ce que depuis la lib\u00e9ration, le requ\u00e9rant a port\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu'il n'aurait pas pu apporter parce qu'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu?",
        "428": "Comme M. le juge Potocki, je ne voudrais pas rendre le d\u00e9bat interminable, mais je voudrais creuser un point avec le gouvernement fran\u00e7ais, qui a clarifi\u00e9 cette question. Effectivement, la demande d'asile constitue dans ce type d'affaires la seule voie de recours effective. Et vous vous fondez sur l'arr\u00eat MX contre France, qui est bien s\u00fbr devenu M.A. contre France. Mais est-ce qu'il n'y a pas eu une diff\u00e9rence entre les deux affaires? Je laisse de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence soulign\u00e9e par les avocats du requ\u00e9rant. Mais dans l'affaire MX contre France, on avait une ITF. Mais on n'avait pas \u00e0 ce stade un arr\u00eat\u00e9 administratif fixant le paier de renvoi. Ce qui rendait, si j'ai bien compris, la voie administrative impossible. En l'esp\u00e8ce, on avait bien \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque pertinente l'ITF et l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 administratif, ce qui ouvrait la voie administrative. Alors, je n'exclus pas qu'il pourrait y avoir des cons\u00e9quences d'une faute d'appel contre le refus du juge du r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 Libert\u00e9. Mais en pr\u00e9sence d'un arr\u00eat\u00e9 administratif fixant le paie de renvoi, pourquoi la voie administrative n'est pas ouverte \u00e0 un requ\u00e9rant comme le requ\u00e9rant devant nous aujourd'hui?",
        "429": "Merci, monsieur le pr\u00e9sident. J'ai 2 petites questions que vous avez \u00e9clair\u00e9es, mais pas compl\u00e8tement pendant votre plaidoirie. Alors, tout d'abord, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 intern\u00e9es lorsque la loi de d\u00e9fense sociale de 1930 \u00e9tait en vigueur, les requ\u00e9rants ont indiqu\u00e9, et il me semble que \u00e7a n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par le gouvernement, que la CDS de Gand a adopt\u00e9 une approche diff\u00e9rente de celle de la CDS d'Anvers. J'ai mes demands, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il s'agit de 2 institutions du m\u00eame Etat, sur quels fondements et pour quels motifs la CDS des Gand a-t-elle prise cette d\u00e9cision? Et d'abord, qu'est-ce qui, selon vous, explique que la CDS d'Anvers n'a pas suivi la m\u00eame approche \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des requ\u00e9rants? La 2e question, les documents de travaux parlementaires relatifs au projet de loi, et je me r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la loi de 2014, visent \u00e0 contrer... On dit qu'on vise \u00e0 contrer... La loi vise \u00e0 contrer un usage impropre de la mesure d'internement, tandis qu'\u00e0 \u00e9viter qu'une mesure d'internement \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e puisse \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e pour des faits relativement mineurs. D'autre part, on lit m\u00eame que la nouvelle loi n'affectait pas en principe les d\u00e9cisions relatives aux personnes souffrant des troubles mentaux qui avaient commis des faits pouvant donner lieu \u00e0 un internement en vertu de l'ancienne loi de d\u00e9fense sociale, mais pour lesquels l'internement ne sera plus possible en vertu de la nouvelle l\u00e9gislation. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le but de l'article 5, paragraphe 1 de la Convention est de prot\u00e9ger tout individu contre une privation de libert\u00e9 arbitraire ou injustifi\u00e9e, comment vous pensez d\u00e9concilier l'objectif affich\u00e9 de la loi de 2014 d'\u00e9viter l'usage impropre de l'internement avec le fait que la loi, la loi nouvelle, n'a pas vocation \u00e0 remettre en cause les d\u00e9cisions d'internement prises auparavant pour les personnes qui ne remplissaient plus les crit\u00e8res et pour \u00eatre intern\u00e9es? Merci beaucoup.",
        "430": "Merci, monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question au gouvernement, mais peut-\u00eatre le repr\u00e9sentant du r\u00e9querant pourra commenter aussi ce point. La nature du risque que posent les deux r\u00e9querants. Je n'ai pas bien compris la plaidoirie. Est-ce que c'est un risque pour la vie et la sant\u00e9 d'autres personnes? Est-ce que c'est un risque de commettre des d\u00e9lits contre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens d'autres personnes? Ou est-ce que c'est un risque que les r\u00e9querants posent pour eux-m\u00eames? On a entendu parler de ce r\u00e9querant retrouv\u00e9 dans la neige. Quels sont les risques contre lesquels on doit prot\u00e9ger soit les r\u00e9querants, soit la soci\u00e9t\u00e9? La nature exacte des risques contre lesquels on doit adopter des mesures protectives. Je voudrais demander un \u00e9claircissement sur ce point. Merci.",
        "431": "Thank you very much. I would like to follow up to the question posed by Judge Felici that is related to the parliamentary procedures and actually the way how would you explain the interplay between two principles, and this is the principle of the prohibition of retroactivity and the principle of proportionality. Namely, if I am correct by reading the documents, one of the statements by the Minister of Justice was that this new provision could not be applied to the persons who have been committed according to the criminal law because of the principle of legality and because of the prohibition of retroactivity because retroactivity is not applicable to the measures of security, but how then this plays with the principle of proportionality, which is the main principle determining the application of the measures of security. So, if you could a little bit explain what was your position on and what is the position on that and interplay and how do you see that? This is the first question, and then the second question relates to..., the request is not that, if I understood correctly, that applicants should be released. The request is that they should be changed, the commitment according to the criminal law should be changed into the commitment according to the civil law. So, if you could specify once again shortly for us the difference and what benefits and in which way these benefits to the applicants. Thank you very much.",
        "432": "Thank you. I have a question for the government, which relates to the application of the third criterion of legality under your new law. And I'm referring to section 9 of the 2014 law, paragraph 1 and sub-paragraph Roman numeral 3. As I understand it, that third criterion of legality is that there should be a danger that the person will commit fresh offenses, as referred to paragraph 1, which, again, in my reading, seems to set a threshold of dangerousness for the measure to be legal. But how is that to apply? So again, will commit fresh offenses of the kind referred to in paragraph 1, which is harm the physical or mental integrity of another person. But how is that to be applied to a detainee, a person, who has never committed any of the offenses in paragraph 1? And I think the same would arise again under section 66 of the new law, which governs the full release. And again, it says that the condition is stabilized sufficiently so that the individual concerned will again not commit offenses that reach that threshold of severity. Thank you.",
        "433": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have two questions, one which I would like to direct to the government and the third party governmental intervenors, but of course the applicants and the Rights UK could give an answer as well. And then I would have one question for the applicants. My first question to the government is, I would preface it with the following. This complaint before us is limited to an allegation of a violation of the procedural limb of Article II. So the conduct that is being challenged is the investigation by Germany. We are not being asked to take a position on Germany's negative potential violation of Article II. The preface is important because my question is this. Assuming for the sake of argument that we would agree with the government that this is a Behrami and Saramati case. So the operational conduct of Germany, the actual strike would be attributable to the UN putting aside the debate between Sir James and Professor Akande on whether it's effective control or ultimate authority. We would stipulate that that would be the case, but the conduct we are asked to examine is not the strike. It is the investigation. So my question is this, is it the argument of the government that then attributability would not only relate to the operation itself, but the conduct of the investigation would also be attributable, would also fall under attributability. And the reason I ask this is, and I want to direct because it was not mentioned by the parties this morning, Article III of the status of the international security, the status of ISAF, which states, and I quote, \"the ISAF and supporting personnel, including associated liaison personnel, will under all circumstances and at all times be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the respective national elements in respect of any criminal or disciplinary offenses which may be committed by them on the territory of Afghanistan\". May I ask you to comment under your jurisdictional ratione personae on the relevance, potential relevance for our assessment as regards to SOFA agreement. And my second limb to that is also as regards jurisdiction ratione loci. The argument is made that even assuming we also agree that Gusulierto doesn't apply ipso facto to an extraterritorial military theater, could you comment on whether this provision, which I just mentioned, why it would not constitute a special feature within the meaning of the Gusulierto line of case law, allowing for the acceptance of a jurisdictional link in this case. My question to the applicants is the following. Professor Akande made clear, as I understand, you correct me if I'm wrong, that this case is very similar to Al-Skaini. You have a security theater. May I then ask you to comment on the arguments in paragraph 40 to 43 of the German, the observations of the German government, which attempts to make a distinction between the fall of the Ba'ath regime in Iraq and the difference here, which is that Afghanistan retained itself the main competences when it came to security operations and the ISAF was merely lending support. And according to the German government, that is a crucial distinction which would distinguish this case from Al-Skaini. Thank you.",
        "434": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question goes primarily to the government. And I want to define a little bit more in detail the scope of the case, and in particular, the scope of the procedural obligation. If I understood the government's position correctly, you argue that you were not allowed to investigate in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the applicant's side argues that Germany failed to examine certain issues in Afghanistan. Now, we know that in Afghanistan, certain procedures were dealt with, in particular by ISAF, in particular by local authorities and by the UN. Now, my question is, what of those results, independently whether it came from Afghan authorities, ISAF authorities, or the UN, did the German authorities take into account when assessing the case? And were there certain reports or results coming from Afghanistan which you did deliberately not take into account? Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "435": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have two questions, one for the representative of the government and one for the applicant. My first question, which is also perhaps relevant to the intervening governments, is about the relationship between human rights law and international humanitarian law. If I read your written observations correctly, in paragraph 83, the government is pointing out that, I quote, \"international humanitarian law also provides the appropriate yardstick here\", end of quote. I'm asking myself, what exactly are you referring to in terms of the yardstick? I take it that the government is not claiming any kind of derogation over here. But perhaps the government could clarify, what exactly are the standards under international humanitarian law in terms of how a government has to investigate violations of IHL? Are there any norms? Because I'm missing any kind of information on that so far. Now I turn to the applicant with another question. This relates to the failure to investigate. The council has repeated the argument today that the applicant was not involved in the investigation and that there was no kind of direct contact to any of the next of king of the victims. So my question is as follows. What information could the applicant or the next of king or villagers around the region could have provided the state authorities with, which would be significant and relevant in order to determine whether the incidental loss of civilian life could have been anticipated by the colonel who ordered the bombing? That's my question. Thank you.",
        "436": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question, I think, primarily for the government, but the applicant can also reply to that question. It's about the scope of the investigation in Germany in relationship to the applicable German law, German criminal law. I understand that the relevant provision of the Code of Crimes Against International Law provides that there is no criminal liability if the accused was not aware of the presence of civilians. That's a subjective element, and that has also been stressed by the parties. Now, does this exclude holding a person criminally liable for objective reasons, negligence, lack of precautions, disproportionate use of force? Is that something that would have to be examined under the criminal code? And my question then is, the real question is, would an investigation into the sole subjective element about the awareness of the presence of civilians, would an investigation limited to that in any event be sufficient under German law and also under the applicable rules of the Convention and perhaps also of international humanitarian law? If not, to what extent did the investigation cover these other elements, not the subjective element, but precautionary measures, disproportionate use, et cetera? It's a question for me of knowing exactly what the situation is in principle under German law, or primarily under German law, but perhaps with extensions to the Convention too. Thank you.",
        "437": "Just a short one on the jurisdiction. Could we say that the jurisdiction of Germany could derive not only from the national law, not only from the agreement that has been mentioned, but as well from the ICC statute Article 12, I think it's paragraph 2B or 1B. Could you comment on that? Thank you",
        "438": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question for the government. The government have made reference to the prosecutor's order and that they were all finally reviewed by the prosecutor's office at the Bulgarian Supreme Court of Cassation by an order which is dated 27th of January, 2017. I think this order in order to simplify, but the government already have referred to the reasoning which is contained in most of these orders. This order finds that the full investigation and underline this concept appear to have been carried out, but it did not reveal that the applicants have been subjected to any ill treatment. The prosecutor then examined the applicant's statements and found the applicant's initial statement to the psychologists and their replies when they were questioned by the Italian prosecutor before the youth court had been at variance with each other and contained contradictions. Therefore the prosecutor expressed the hypothesis that the children had seen sexual acts on television or that they had seen other persons performing them. Therefore the conclusion was that in view of their parents' disapproval of this behavior of the children and in order to avoid upsetting the parents, the children had told the story \u2013 this is a quotation \u2013 claiming to be victims of abuse. My question concerns this relationship between these two concepts. Full investigation, which we find in this order, and possible contradictions in the children depositions concerning abuse, which I understand these contradictions might occur in children depositions. What were the standards? This is the question in the country at the time of the facts for a full investigation into sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children. And you might also want to comment how were contradictions in the declarations of children assessed in the light of standard of evidence on child abuse. Thank you.",
        "439": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. Let me first start with the question for the government, namely, in their accounts before the Italian authorities, the applicants mentioned specifically by name several other children from the orphanage that were involved in sexual abuse, either as victims or as perpetrators or both. It transpires from the file, and it was repeated today by the government, that the Bulgarian authorities heard several children in the course of investigation. My first question is whether those children specifically named by the applicants in their accounts were amongst those children heard by the Bulgarian authorities. Now, my second question is directed both to the applicants and to the government. In their pleadings today, but also in other documents submitted to the court, the government alleges deficiencies in interviews conducted with children before Italian authorities and other Italian institutions for several reasons. Now, I would first invite the applicants to comment on those alleged deficiencies, as alleged by the Bulgarian government. And I have a question in this respect directed to the Bulgarian government. It appears from your pleadings and from the documents in the file that the Bulgarian authorities never requested any legal assistance from the Italian authorities. In particular, the Bulgarian authorities did not request another hearing or a hearing of the applicants or their psychological evaluation or medical examination, although certain deficiencies are asserted by the Bulgarian authorities. How come never such a request was forwarded to the Italian authorities in light of such deficiencies asserted by the Bulgarian authorities? And my final question is also directed to the Bulgarian government. It's a follow-up of the facts and the question as highlighted by my colleague Judge Sabato. In their final conclusion, the Bulgarian prosecution authorities provided certain explanation as to why, in their view, the applicants' allegations did not correspond to the reality and why they allegedly were not reliable. I wonder whether that particular hypothesis, as highlighted in that prosecutorial decision, was ever put to any expert evaluation, in the sense that any expert in Bulgaria or elsewhere would evaluate those statements, their veracity, for the purpose of Bulgarian inquiry and come up to such a conclusion as then highlighted in that particular prosecutorial decision. Thank you so much.",
        "440": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Donc, mes questions sont au gouvernement et \u00e0 la partie recurrente, sont les suivantes. Donc, les deux, en commen\u00e7ant par les r\u00e9currents, ils ont invoqu\u00e9 certaines normes internationales, notamment la Convention sur le droit des enfants, certains commentaires qui sont issus par le Comit\u00e9 sur le droit des enfants, notamment le commentaire 4, relative \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 des enfants. Aussi, la Convention qui est fondamentale pour nous, la protection des enfants contre l'exploitation et l'abus sexuel, dite la Convention de l'Ansaroth\u00e9. Ma question est, \u00e9tant tous ces documents internationaux que je ne vais pas citer, parce que vous les connaissez autant bien que moi, est-ce que vous pensez qu'il y a des normes minimales internationales concernant l'investigation effective des abus sexuels ou des plaintes par rapport aux abus sexuels? Ma deuxi\u00e8me question est adress\u00e9e au gouvernement, et est une question qui suit d'une certaine mani\u00e8re la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e par mon coll\u00e8gue, le juge Sabato, et par la suite par mon coll\u00e8gue, le juge Bo\u0161njak. Est-ce que vous connaissez l'affaire? Vous avez invoqu\u00e9 beaucoup des affaires de la Cour. Est-ce que vous connaissez l'affaire Fernandes Pedroso contre le Portugal, qui est rest\u00e9e d\u00e9finitive en septembre 2018? Est-ce que vous pouvez commenter certaines all\u00e9gations du gouvernement bulgare par rapport \u00e0 certains faits qui sont mis en \u00e9vidence par cette affaire? Je vous remercie, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "441": "Thank you, President. I have three questions, one for the applicants and two for the government. For the applicants, I would like to know if there are any recent medical or psychological evaluations of the children regarding their mental well-being. Do they still show or show now signs of trauma related to the alleged events that took place at the orphanage? To the government, and these questions can also be addressed by the applicants. The first question relates to the policy of deinstitutionalization. Is this policy, the state's policy to deinstitutionalize, which resulted in the closing of the orphanage, an indicator of systemic child abuse in Bulgarian state institutions? The second question refers to the investigation. Is there any indication of bias towards allegations of sexual abuse of minors in Bulgaria? I put this question against the background of SD versus Bulgaria, which noted systemic problems with effectiveness of investigations regarding violations of Article 2 and 3. I quote the court, this court, \"apart from repeated findings of failure to carry out necessary investigative measures in certain cases, the court noted that the competent authorities had not taken account of certain evidence and had not sought to sustain certain factual circumstances or the involvement of certain individuals in the criminal offense. And then the court concludes, this non-exhaustive list of the various flaws found in a large number of cases reveals the existence of a systemic problem concerning the ineffectiveness of investigations in Bulgaria\". And this refers to Article 2 and 3 complaints. I also take into account, as a background, the committee on the Rights of Children report of 2018, which states at the concluding observations that it is concerned, the committee is concerned, and I quote, with the sexual abuse among and against children living in institutional care homes in Bulgaria. So is there a problem with the effectiveness, a systemic problem with the effectiveness of investigations regarding these type of crimes? This is the question put to the government. Thank you.",
        "442": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question for the government and another for the applicants. Starting with the first one, I would like to know more about the research or investigation in the orphanage. Concretely, you have said that these interviews were done by psychologists and social workers, now in the hearing, but I read also in the files that some of the research was done by the police directly. Then I want to know if the police did the interview to the children and also if the people, the workers from the orphanage, were there present in this research or in this investigation. How was it done? That's all for the government. And then going to the applicants, I would like to have more information about the way you have used to denounce these facts and why you go to the media first or to some journalist instead of to, I don't say to the Bulgarian authorities, but why don't go to the official domestic institutions in Italy, even if they have no jurisdiction and so on, but just to go to the prosecutor or also to civil domestic national Italian authorities. Why was that done in another way or what was the way? Thank you very much.",
        "443": "Thank you very much. You have extensively criticized the method that was used in Italy in questioning the children. I would like to know what kind of method were Bulgarian authorities using interviewing the children and why this method was better, if some method was used. Then what kind of follow up Bulgarian authorities are doing when children are adopted or when they get the information that some problems might exist? More concretely, did you contact and follow up what was happening with the children coming from the same orphanage who were adopted approximately at the same time? And then the area that was not at all addressed is the issue that interests me, and these are preventive measures. We have heard a number of preventive measures that have been taken in terms of the possibility of adults to come to the orphanage and to have access to the children. What kind of preventive measures Bulgarian authorities have in institutions like this one to prevent possible sexual abuse among or between children themselves? And at what age sexual education of children in Bulgaria starts? If it is there at all. Thank you.",
        "444": "Thank you, Mr. President. Can you hear me okay? Yes. I have two questions that are addressed to both sides, two legal questions, and then a factual question for the government. The first legal question is about protection at school. Now, both sides have placed some emphasis on this issue, the applicants arguing that it was not possible to extend the barring order, the police barring order, immediately to the school, and the argument arguing on the other side, conversely, that the applicant could have applied for a judicial temporary protection order which would apply to the school and that they did not do that. My question is the following. Both of those positions assume that a barring order or a protection order of some sort covering the school would provide adequate protection in the circumstances. And my question is, why do you assume that? Why do you assume that a legal order would prevent a father in a mental situation, in an emotional situation, who is prepared to kill his own children? My second question goes to the relationship between Article 2 and Article 5 of the Convention. Now, I am aware, if I understand correctly today, from the government submissions, that the government's case rests on the argument that no real and immediate threat was discernible to the authorities at the time, at least with respect to the children. But please, for the sake of argument, let's assume that a real and immediate threat was discernible, but at the same time, that legal national conditions for detaining the husband were not met. And so, in a way, let's assume that a case like this fell somewhere in the middle. And my question is, what would the Article 2 obligations of the government be in that situation, when there is a threat, but not enough to meet the detention standard, or any restriction of liberty of the alleged threat, source of the threat? My final question is for the government, but the applicant is, of course, welcome to comment. If I understood correctly, government's counsel today argued that at the time of the issuing of the barring order, the police did use some form of standardized risk assessment. And my question is, what was the standard? On what kind of standard, whether nationally developed or internationally developed and widely recognized standard that risk assessment was based? And if you could also comment, this is related, on a recent submission by the applicant on 12th of June, so about a week ago. The applicant submitted an Annex 43. It's an article from the Journal of Police Science and Police Practice, 2015. And this article describes that after the events in this case, so sometime between late 2013 and June 2014, the Austrian authorities developed and tested a risk assessment tool known as SALFAG. It was tested in three provinces, in Vienna, Upper Austria, and Vorarlberg, but that it was then decided not to roll it out nationally and is not in use currently. And according to the author of this article, the main reason for that is that it would add about 10 to 15 minutes of time to the consideration of cases of this nature by the police. And so if you could please be so kind to comment on whether this article is correct in its assertions. Thank you.",
        "445": "Thank you very much. I would like to follow up somewhat on the first question that my colleague just asked. There was a barring order here in this case, and it applied to the homes. It would have been possible under the law to obtain a temporary restraining order, but as I understand it, it would still apply to the homes, but could be for a longer period of time. And there would also be a possibility of obtaining a temporary injunction, and that could be extended then to other places, including the school. My question is, to what degree is that a more effective protection, not only for the reason that my colleague asked, namely that it is another legal act, but why would it not be possible for a violent husband to kill a person outside the places that are mentioned in all of these orders? We are concentrating on the school because the murder happened there, but would it not have been possible to find another place to kill the children? Thank you.",
        "446": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have questions to both parties, and I start with the applicants. First, I recall the sequence of events. The applicant reported her husband to the police on 22nd May 2012, 1.05 PM. The tragic murder was, as you all know, committed on 25th May by 8.10 AM, a bit less than three days later. Now, at what point during these three days do you think the police authorities should have become aware that the applicant's husband was a danger to her children, even in their school, and that it was not sufficient to bar him from the common flat already on 22nd May, 1.05 PM, or at a later moment? And I ask this because the applicant said in her police interview immediately after the murder on 25th May that she knew, and I quote, she knew that something like this would happen. And she added that for the last two days, this means on 23rd and 24th May, her husband, and I quote again, had called her several times a day because he always wanted to meet her and the children together. Why did the applicant not report these frequent phone calls to the police? And another question, did she tell her consultant from the Center for Protection from Violence about these phone calls? And I remind you that this consultant, immediately after the murder, stated explicitly that she, and I quote, the consultant, had never expected the applicant's husband to commit such an act. This does not quite match. And my question to the government are, the applicant instituted state liability proceedings in 2014, and her claim was, as you are all aware, that the public prosecutor's office should have requested that her husband be held in pretrial detention. Now, my question, on the evening of 22nd May, when the public prosecutor decided not to take the applicant's husband into pretrial detention, he acted on the basis of various police reports that he had received by email in the late evening of the same day, including the applicant's witness statement. Now, was this sufficient information for the public prosecutor's decision on pretrial detention? Or should he have interviewed the applicant right away, for instance, on the next day? Would this have changed the prosecutor's assessment concerning pretrial detention? And what is the general law and practice in such cases? And my last question, following up to what I asked the applicant, if the public prosecutor had known that the applicant had received frequent phone calls by her husband on 23rd and 24th May, and his wish to see his wife and children urgently, could this have changed their mind with regard to the necessity of pretrial detention? Thank you.",
        "447": "Thank you very much. I understand from the applicant's written and oral submissions that the applicant is advocating more frequent recourse to detention of the alleged perpetrator in the context of domestic violence for the purposes of effective prevention. I would like you to comment on how this position would accord with the provisions and the standards that are applicable under Article 5 of the Convention. And in particular, are you actually suggesting or implying that the court should review and reconsider the current interpretation of the provisions governing detention under Article 5? Of course, the government is also welcome to comment on this issue. And in this context also, I would be curious to hear your comments about how effectively an increased recourse to detention would actually ensure effective deterrence, because detention cannot be indefinite. So is there a risk that even detention would actually postpone further acts rather than effectively prevent them? Thank you.",
        "448": "Thank you very much. We have in our file that actually the husband has been convicted of bodily harm and dangerous threatening behavior just one year before the incident and actually he got three months imprisonment that was suspended for three years with probation and what he has done he actually has done during the probation period. And I'm not sure, we have heard that discussions around the bearing order and that he never violated the bearing order but actually he violated the conditions of the suspended sentence. So if you could explain to what extent in which way domestic authorities are actually obliged to take that into consideration when they are deciding upon the imposing pretrial detention or bearing orders or any kinds of restraint related. Second question that I have is related to the last part of the Osman test which says which judge reasonably might have been expected to avoid that risk. Reasonably might have been expected to avoid that risk. So what is the causal link or should be the causal link between what has happened and of what could have prevented. How closely that has to be connected. Thank you very much.",
        "449": "Thank you, Mr. President. But Judge Turkovi\u0107 just quoted in his first question my question, so I'm satisfied. Thank you.",
        "450": "Thank you very much. I have only one factual question concerning the applicant. I don't want to blame the victim. I know that they are in a very, very difficult position. But I wonder if I'm not mistaken, I didn't find in the statement of facts any note regarding the character, the temper and aggressive behavior of husband towards her and her children. And on the other side, his very polite attitude towards the others. So I would like to ask why, if she was able, the applicant, if she was able to report her husband to the police on Tuesday, 22nd May 2012, and she was able to speak about really very, very awkward situation, very intimate, etc., etc., why she did not mention also this fact? Thank you very much.",
        "451": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have only some factual question for the applicant and also for the government. It's about culture. The government has said that in the victims, the violence, domestic violence, there is also some advice related with the cultural backgrounds. Then I want to know if in this case, that's for the government, this advice was done. And for the applicant also, I want to know how many years the applicant was living in Austria. She was born there or not, how she manages in German, and what was the level of studies and her job. That's quite factual. Thank you very much.",
        "452": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My question is addressed to both parties. As it appears from your pleadings, it is a common ground that originally a request for family reunification was made on 4th November 2015, which was refused first by the Danish Immigration Office and finally by the Immigration Appeals Board in September 2016. As it appears also from your pleadings, it is a common ground that family reunification was granted on 24th June 2019. The applicant argues that he applied again for family reunification on 26th April 2018, that the government rejected his application on 22 October 2018 and requested additional information in particular pertaining to the authenticity of his marriage, which the applicant subsequently provided and the family reunification was granted on 24th June 2019. On the other hand, the government argues at paragraph 12 of their memorial that the applicant applied for family reunification on 12 February 2019 and that on 24 June 2019 the request was approved. My question is how many times the applicant applied for family reunification, in particular when the applicant's second request was rejected and was requested to provide additional information pertaining to the authenticity of his marriage, as the applicant argues. Was this submission of additional information made in the context of a third request or as a part of the second request? Another question to both parties. What was the reason of the delay for examining the last request for reunification and why eventually the applicant had to stay four years and a half in Denmark from January 2015 up to 24 June 2019 to be permitted to have family reunification? Thank you very much.",
        "453": "First of all, I would like to thank the parties and all the interveners for their very clear statements. I have a question to the representative of the government, but of course also the representative of the applicant is invited to reply. The question relates to the application of section 9c paragraph 1 of the Danish Aliens Act, the provision that provides for granting residence permits to family members within the three years waiting period in exceptional situations. From the explanatory report to the law that introduced this waiting period, I got the impression that such an exceptional situation would only be accepted in a very few circumstances. However, in your introductory remarks, you mentioned that in a substantial number of cases, this provision has been applied. My question is, could you please, in the second round, repeat the numbers you mentioned, and could you please provide us with a number of concrete situations in which this exceptional situation has been accepted? Thank you.",
        "454": "Merci beaucoup, M. le pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question, donc, deux questions qui sont adress\u00e9es au requ\u00e9rant, mais rien n'emp\u00eache, bien entendu, le gouvernement d'apporter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments si n\u00e9cessaires. La premi\u00e8re question est la suivante. Pourquoi l'\u00e9pouse du requ\u00e9rant, c'est-\u00e0-dire Mme Jen, n'a jamais demand\u00e9 l'asile au Danemark? Et ma deuxi\u00e8me question est la suivante. Quelle \u00e9tait la situation, donc, de cette dame, de Mme Jen? Donc, quelle \u00e9tait sa situation en Syrie pendant que son mari r\u00e9sidait seul au Danemark? Elle avait un travail stable, par exemple? Par exemple? Je vous remercie, M. le pr\u00e9sident.",
        "455": "Thank you. Perfect. Well, thank you to both parties. I have two questions, one for the government and another for the applicant. For the government, a very concrete one related to the differences between the application of the Article Section 7.3, 7.2, or 7.1. And then, could you explain the differences in the procedure dealing with a request for protection in order to substantiate in the interviews the real and personal risk of a treatment contrary to Article 3 due to the individual circumstances that upon return she or he can suffer? Then my question is about these interviews and the assessment to classify these asylum seekers in one of these three situations. My other question for the applicant is very short. You have said in your observations, well, then I want to ask in which arguments do you support your statement that in your case to say that the need for protection was only temporary was a pure speculation? Why you say that it was a pure speculation? And nothing else. Thank you very much.",
        "456": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to ask a question relating to Article 14, and it is a little bit prompted by what Mr. Chablais said at the end. Assuming that there are here comparable situations, assuming that there is a legitimate aim for the difference in treatment, the question arises whether the means to create this difference in treatment are relevant for the aims pursued. Mr. Braad said that the reasons for the 2015 amendments were, on the one hand, to offer protection as long as needed, and on the other hand, to ensure that the return is possible when there is no longer a need for protection. So then my question comes, to what extent is this specific difference in treatment based on the waiting period for the right to family reunification? To what extent is it relevant for the aims pursued? Thank you.",
        "457": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question, and it is directed to the government, and it concerns the choice for the duration of the waiting period. I understand the pleadings of the applicant to be that the applicant is not, as such, calling into question the legitimacy of introducing a waiting period. And in his observations, a waiting period of one year would have been reasonable, but he's challenging the three-year waiting period. My question is, when it was introduced in 2015, it was one year. When it was amended in 2016, it became three years. I assume that the government has been must have reflected on whether it should be one year, two years, three years, or four years. And therefore, my question is, why did the government opt for three years? One year would have been the recommendation of the Commissioner of Human Rights. Two years would have been the EU Family Reunification Directive from 2003. Three years seems to be the legislation in Sweden and other places. But could you shed some light on why the government opted for three years, or to ask in a more direct way, was it to have as long a period as possible, which was still compatible with international obligations? Thank you.",
        "458": "Thank you very much. Just two questions. I don't know whether I understood properly, but now apparently there is the law that applies three years to all the groups. So could you explain what was the reason to extend to all the groups? And the second question, am I wrong? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. And then the second question is, we heard today a couple of times that different groups are affected differently. I would be interested whether you have data whether such legislation affects women comparatively much more than men. Thank you very much.",
        "459": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai trois questions \u00e0 poser aux partis, une au gouvernement, une au requ\u00e9rant et, finalement, une troisi\u00e8me commune aux deux partis. La premi\u00e8re, donc, est dirig\u00e9e au gouvernement. Combien d'affaires similaires \u00e0 celles du requ\u00e9rant sont actuellement pendantes devant les juridictions islandaises? Je vous demande un chiffre approximatif, bien entendu. Une question, donc, dirig\u00e9e au requ\u00e9rant. Devant les juridictions nationales, le requ\u00e9rant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre rejug\u00e9. Il me semble que cette pr\u00e9tention n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e devant la Chambre. Par cons\u00e9quent, je voudrais savoir si le requ\u00e9rant demande \u00e0 la Grande Chambre \u00e0 \u00eatre rejug\u00e9 en Islande, en plus, bien entendu, de la r\u00e9paration p\u00e9cuniaire de 5 000 euros qu'il formule au titre de l'article 41 de la Convention. Et enfin, une derni\u00e8re question commune aux deux partis. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque des faits de l'esp\u00e8ce, quels \u00e9taient les liens entre la ministre de la Justice, Mme Andersen, la police et les procureurs? Je vous remercie, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "460": "Thank you, President. I have three questions. One for the applicant, one for the government, and the third one for both parties. Now, the applicant accuses the Minister of Justice of this most abject, backstage, horse-trading deal between members of the same party. There would have been a deal between the former Minister of Justice and candidate BN to Reykjavik, according to which Judge AE, who is the wife of BN, would go to the Court of Appeal if BN would step down in favor of the Minister. So there is, in your view, clear quid pro quo, a deal, and personal political gain of the former Minister of Justice. And you even said that there is bad faith bordering intent. My question is, was there any criminal investigation or prosecution launched against the former Minister of Justice on this basis, alleged abuse of power or corruption? You have mentioned the deficiencies of the Supreme Court's oversight over this entire procedure. You have pointed out the fact that the Supreme Court did not address this argument in its judgment of May 2018. The Supreme Court said there was no nullity, no major defect in the appointment procedure, confirming its judgment of December 2017. My question is the following. Is it your view that the Supreme Court should have annulled the Minister's decision in its judgment of December 2017? I would like to recall the passage of the Supreme Court's decision with regard to the request of annulment of the Minister's decision. The Supreme Court said the following, and I'm quoting the Supreme Court, it is not in the power of the courts to decide who should be appointed to the office of judge of the Court of Appeal. Bearing this in mind and having received the appellant's explanation as to the nature of their claim, which will serve as a basis here, the appellants have not demonstrated that they have a lawful interest in obtaining a court ruling on the invalidity of decisions by the Minister of Justice. This is the decision of the Supreme Court upholding the district court's judgments insofar as they concern the request of annulment of the Minister's decision. Is it your position that this is wrong in law and the Supreme Court did not exercise full jurisdiction over the Minister's decision and should have done so? With regard to the government, after the delivery of the chamber judgment, the Minister of Justice resigned from office. Why so? If the judgment of the chamber is wrong, there is no reason to resign. The only reason to resign is if the judgment of the chamber is right. But then the question might be raised, why is the government appealing the decision of the chamber if it is right? Final question addressed to both parties. In the criminal proceedings against the applicant, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's motion for AE to withdraw from his case. But it decided so with the participation of AE. AE intervened in the judgment itself where the impartiality was at stake. Would you comment on this? Thank you very much.",
        "461": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a legal question to both parties. It's true that during their pleadings they touched upon it indirectly, but I think for the sake of clarity I will ask it again. Do you think that the requirements for a fair hearing, establishment by law, independence, and impartiality are self-standing requirements or if they are interrelated? And if interrelated, is there a hierarchy between them? Thank you.",
        "462": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have one question, which at the same time is addressed to both parties. And the question is concerned the link between a possible finding of a violation of Article VI established by law and the possible consequences to be drawn from such a finding, meaning the link between Article VI and Article 46 of the convention. The applicant is arguing that there has been a violation of Article VI and that there has to be a reopening. The government, on the other hand, is arguing there has been no violation of Article VI and obviously no need to reopen. My question is more in general. To what extent, and could the parties elaborate on, to what extent will a finding of a violation of Article VI necessitate a reopening or whether it would necessitate the court to indicate reopening? Or in other words, which kinds of violations of Article VI would necessitate the reopening? Is the threshold under Article VI, the threshold for finding a violation of Article VI established by law, is it necessarily the same threshold which the court should apply under Article 46 when deciding whether or not to indicate as an individual measure the reopening of the procedures? So if both parties could clarify their view on that question. Thank you.",
        "463": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have three questions. I'd like to follow up and repeat the question asked by my colleague, Judge Ravarani, concerning the interrelationship in Article 6.1 fair trial assessments by this court of the criteria related to establishment by law, independence, and impartiality. And I repeat the question not for the sake of it, but rather to leave both parties in no doubt that the bench wants an answer to this question. My second question is also addressed to both parties, but particularly to the applicant. Both parties have examined in detail and in general terms questions relating to the irregularities recognized by the Icelandic Supreme Court in the appointment of court of appeal judges. But I'd like to ask both parties to return their focus to the applicant's individual case. The respondent government addressed this in their submissions, but in my view, the applicant could address it a little bit more. According to the constant case law of this court, our primary concern in examining an Article 6.1 complaint is, and I quote, to evaluate the overall fairness of the applicant's criminal proceedings. So could both parties please tell us or repeat how the criminal proceedings involving the applicant heard at district court level, at which stage the applicant pleaded guilty, heard on appeal by the court of appeal, and then again at Supreme Court level. In what way were these proceedings unfair due to the irregular appointment of four out of 15 court of appeal judges? And of course, here I'm asking you not just to address questions as of consequence, but rather questions of cause and effect. And my third question is a follow-on question from Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, and I apologize to him in advance if I've misunderstood his question, and I apologize in particular to both parties if I misunderstand Icelandic law, but I'm not an Icelandic judge. And the question relates to Judge Pinto de Albuquerque's question about the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to annul the ministerial decision. Now, what I haven't understood is whether he is referring to the Supreme Court decisions in the damages cases brought by the candidates whose names had been removed from the list, or to the Supreme Court judgment in the applicant's case. But in either or both cases under Icelandic law, did the Supreme Court have any jurisdiction whatsoever in the context of those proceedings to annul the ministerial decision? And particularly, did the Supreme Court have jurisdiction to act in that way in the context of the applicant's case, which was, of course, an appeal from the Court of Appeal and on from the District Court concerning the commission of traffic offenses driving under the influence of narcotics and without a license? Thank you very much.",
        "464": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have some factual questions, first of all, to the representatives of the government, but I invite also the representative of the applicant to comment if he wishes so. My first question refers to the 15 candidates on their lists as amended by the minister, as exchanged by the minister. We see that in that list, we had candidates number 7, 11, 12, and 14 removed and replaced by candidates numbers 17, 18, 23, and the 30th. I would like to understand the criteria. Why these numbers? Why wasn't it the 12, the 13, the 14, and the 15, and then the 16, 17, and so on? Was there any logic in that, especially in the light of, my question is in the light of the applicant's representative remark that a female judge, who was numbered 22, was not selected to the new composition, and she was not selected to the new composition. But a female judge, who was number 30, was selected. So was there any logic? Were there any objective criteria or justifiable criteria which the minister employed when changing the list of candidates? That's my one question. My other question relates to the statement of facts. And in the statement of facts, we have a letter of the chairman of the evaluation committee who provided that letter to the Minister of Justice on the 28th of May, 2017. That is one day before the amended or modified list of candidates was presented to the parliament on the eve of that presentation. And in that letter, the chairman of the committee, of the evaluation committee, objected to the changing of weightings and, by extension, to the recomposition of the group of candidates which was already in place. And I just quote that, according to the chairman, changing the weightings after the composition of the group of candidates for the benefit of particular candidates and to the disadvantage of others had to be avoided. I put emphasis on the word particular, benefit of particular candidates. Could you please shed some light on what was meant by the word particular candidates? The chairman of the committee used plural. What was meant by particular candidates? Or at least what the minister from that letter could understand or ought to have understood by the word particular? And my third question, also a factual question, will be very straightforward. And that was partly prompted by Judge Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque's question about this alleged swap of services or horse trading. He used the term horse trading. The chairman of the parliamentary committee giving his place on the party's constituency list to the minister just not long after the nomination of an appointment of his wife to that judicial position. My question would be very straightforward, maybe unusually straightforward. But could you please tell whether that was a coincidence, a lack of judgment, or a quid pro quo? Plainly, thank you.",
        "465": "Thank you very much. I would just like to expand a little bit on the question that was asked by Judge Kj\u00f8lbro. And this is the relationship between Article 6 and finding a violation and the consequences. And not just the reopening, because it seems to me that we have something intermediary, and this is annulment of the judgment. So are you pleading for the automatic annulment of the judgment? Or there could be instances where automatic and under which conditions automatic annulment then would not be required. And what is then the consequence of that for the reopening? In other words, could reopening be mandated by the court? And or at the domestic level, could reopening be requested not only by the applicant, but by the government? Because in a case like this, the applicant might not have an incentive to ask for the reopening. At the domestic level, annulment of the judgment, how it is connected to \"ne bis in idem\", and how it is connected to statute of limitation. Would in this particular case statute of limitation be there if the judgment would be annulled? Thank you.",
        "466": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'avais demand\u00e9 au... Je me dirige au requ\u00e9rant.

        "467": "Thank you, President. I have two questions concerning the incident of 14th December, 2013. And my first question goes to the applicant. In your submissions, you state that this alleged incident was related to questioning the applicant about two issues. First, death of Mr. Zhvania in 2005, and situation with bank accounts of Mr. Saakashvili. Why you consider that it was important for the authorities to obtain this information at that particular moment? And my second question is for the government, but the applicant might comment as well, in respect of the effectiveness of investigation into this incident of 14th December, 2013, to which extent the applicant himself was involved into this investigation. Thank you very much.",
        "468": "Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser une question au gouvernement et une autre question au requ\u00e9rant. Bien \u00e9videmment, chaque parti pourrait commenter sur ces questions. La question au gouvernement. Le requ\u00e9rant vient de nous dire que parmi les personnes d\u00e9tenues avec lui \u00e0 la Facilit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de Straubing, la majorit\u00e9 ne souffre pas de troubles mentaux. Le gouvernement, pour sa part, vient de dire que la grande majorit\u00e9 de ces personnes, la grande majorit\u00e9, mais pas tous, souffre de diff\u00e9rentes formes de troubles mentaux. Ma question est la suivante. Dans le syst\u00e8me allemand, tel que modifi\u00e9 depuis 2011, la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive est-elle associ\u00e9e uniquement avec l'existence de troubles mentaux ou bien elle peut \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de condamn\u00e9s dangereux qui ne souffrent pas d'une maladie mentale? Ma deuxi\u00e8me question va au requ\u00e9rant. Elle concerne l'article 5, paragraphe 4 de la Convention. Vous vous plaignez notamment de la dur\u00e9e de la proc\u00e9dure devant la Cour constitutionnelle. Vous avez relev\u00e9 aussi le r\u00f4le particulier de la Cour constitutionnelle allemande. Ma question est la suivante. Aviez-vous la possibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir un nouveau contr\u00f4le de l'ordonnance de placement d'\u00e9tention devant les juridictions ordinaires alors m\u00eame que la proc\u00e9dure ant\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait toujours pendante devant la Cour constitutionnelle? Merci Mr. le President.",
        "469": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My questions are addressed to the government, but of course the applicant can comment on them. I would like the government to elaborate on the concept that is enshrined in the Therapy Detention Act, the \"Therapie Unterbringungsgesetz\", the concept of \"psychische St\u00f6rung\", mental disorder. Does it extend to non-pathological disorders or any other social deviance behavior? Ultimately, who has the final saying with regard to these mental disorders? Is the judge competent or the psychologists or psychiatrists who has the final saying in characterizing this mental disorder? My second question regards the preventive detention itself foreseen by this Therapy Detention Act. Can you explain the nature of this measure in the light of the classic dualism between penalties and security measures in German law? If it is not a penalty, a \"Strafe\", is it a \"Massregel der Besserung\"? Is it a measure of prevention? Or not even a measure of criminal law? But then why is it applied on the basis of a criminal conviction of mentally ill, of mentally sane persons? And in this particular case, in our case, by a criminal chamber? It seems that the Therapy Detention Act foresaw the competence of civil chambers, not criminal chambers. That leads me to my third point, which refers to an issue raised by the government themselves. What is the difference between the internment in a psychiatric hospital under Article 63 of the \"Strafgesetzbuch\" and the internment in preventive detention centers under the \"Therapie Unterbringungsgesetz\"? The government used a word, a very peculiar word. It's approximate. The regimes are approximate. What does this mean in terms of the classic dualism between penalties and security measures in German law? Thank you very much.",
        "470": "Thank you, Mr. President. Can you hear me? Yes, now I'm on. I have a question to the government. The government said that it would be irresponsible to release this person. And I wonder if this implies that the applicant, if released or no longer detained under criminal law, could not be detained under the Bavarian legislation on the detention of dangerous persons of unsound mind where a criminal conviction is not a precondition. Thank you.",
        "471": "Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le requ\u00e9rant. Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, mes questions s'adressent au R\u00e9current, au gouvernement, et en m\u00eame temps, ils visent le probl\u00e8me de l'\u00e2ge tr\u00e8s jeune, jeune du R\u00e9current au moment o\u00f9 il avait commis l'infraction. Donc, une partie importante de la d\u00e9fense du requ\u00e9rant se base sur cet \u00e2ge tr\u00e8s jeune. Le requ\u00e9rant nous avait dit que les experts n'\u00e9taient pas vraiment qualifi\u00e9s pour faire des expertises sur les jeunes adultes ou sur les mineurs. Cette affirmation, maintenant, a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par le gouvernement qui nous avait dit qu'en fait, ces experts avaient cette qualification, mais le gouvernement avait ajout\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l'ordonnance de mise en attention a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e, le requ\u00e9rant n'\u00e9tait plus mineur. Donc, je voulais exactement savoir comment est-ce que le jeune \u00e2ge du requ\u00e9rant, il a jou\u00e9 pendant cette expertise qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pendant l'ordonnance, et comment est-ce que cet \u00e2ge jeune joue aussi par rapport \u00e0 cette mesure pr\u00e9ventive qui est appliqu\u00e9e. Merci beaucoup.",
        "472": "Thank you. I have questions to both parties about the psychiatric treatment. I see that both parties mentioned today that the applicant was subject to the psychological treatment. And this is what I see from the observation of the government and the government mentioned that today that there is a sociopedagogical group measures. However, according to the psychiatric standards, ICD-10, the European standards mentioned by the government in its observations, the treatment also should include some sort of psychopharmaceutical intervention, antipsychotics, antidepressants. So my question is whether there was such a treatment, whether the word therapy included this. This is because the observations of the parties are very controversial about what kind of treatment. So what kind of, whether the treatment was in compliance with the psychiatric standards. The sexual sadism is a very severe disorder. However, under the same standards, there is a scale of severity. Whether the scale of severity was diagnosed by the experts, so whether there is a necessity and requirement that the person with such a disorder should come through the special clinical tests. According to the case file and the observation of the parties, it appears that the diagnosis was taken in accordance with the interviews with the applicant. Just what he said without, or maybe with, this is what I would like to clarify, the point is to clarify whether there was a so-called differential analysis, differential test diagnosis provided for the applicant. I also have a question. Whether there is a requirement under German law that if the person, I mean the very first event when the applicant committed a crime. So the crime was committed, there was a murder, a very serious crime, which the punishment for which is lifelong punishment, which was recognized by the government. So it's a very serious crime, especially aggravated by the sexual act. So whether the psychiatric test, psychiatric examination of such a person is necessary, is obligatory from the very beginning. So it was not done and I have no information whether there is a requirement under German law. Thank you.",
        "473": "Oui, merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Et je voudrais juste demander, on comprend qu'apr\u00e8s les observations des partis, les conditions mat\u00e9rielles dans ces centres de d\u00e9tention, de s\u00fbret\u00e9, sont \u00e9volu\u00e9es. Est-ce qu'on peut dire la m\u00eame chose? Peut-on constater la m\u00eame am\u00e9lioration dans le cadre des soins m\u00e9dicaux, d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, par rapport, je dirais, aux soins qui peuvent \u00eatre prodig\u00e9s dans un h\u00f4pital psychiatrique normal, je dirais, ou civil? Et je veux aussi dire que, dans le cadre du requ\u00e9rant, est-ce qu'on peut dire que ce centre qui se trouve est adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 ses besoins, c'est-\u00e0-dire un traitement pour le sadisme sexuel? Merci beaucoup.",
        "474": "Merci, monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais poser une question qui, sous diff\u00e9rents angles, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e et elle s'adresse aux deux partis, mais aussi sous diff\u00e9rents auspices. Pour le gouvernement, je ne sais pas s'il peut r\u00e9pondre, car la question devrait d'abord \u00eatre pos\u00e9e aux tribunaux. \u00c9tait-il envisageable et envisag\u00e9 de faire juger la question de la d\u00e9tention du requ\u00e9rant apr\u00e8s qu'il avait purg\u00e9 sa peine par des tribunaux civils? Et pour le requ\u00e9rant, quels auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 les avantages concrets, et j'insiste sur concrets, pour lui s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par des tribunaux civils? Merci.",
        "475": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have four questions, some of which come with sub-questions. The first is one of factual clarification. In the respondent government submissions in paragraph 38, it is suggested that an appeal against decision 59 of the administrative court of Laura of the 28th of January 2014 is still pending before the Supreme Court. Can I just clarify, is my understanding right that in fact what is pending before the Supreme Court is only an appeal against the decision 269 of 2014 of the administrative court concerning the, and I quote, gross procedural violation, close quote, in the calculation of the compensation for the expropriation by the Council of Ministers? Secondly, is it right that the appeal against decision 59 of 2014, declaring that the actions carried out by the state in November 2013 were illegal, was finally determined by a judgment of the administrative court of appeal of May 2016? Or in the alternative, did the government appeal against that judgment? And if so, what is the status of that appeal? And if it is appealed, why was neither of these two appeals, i.e. that to the administrative court of appeal, nor that to a Supreme Court, if there is one, mentioned by the government in their submissions to this court? The second question is one of clarification in relation to Albanian law. And my question is this. Does the Albanian law or legislation provide for an effective measure, administrative or other, against the refusal by any party, including an administrative authority, to obey a court order? For example, akin to the concept of contempt of court proceedings available in common law jurisdictions. And if so, have any steps been taken against those responsible for noncompliance with the interim injunction first issued in November 2013? The third question relates to the events of the 3rd of November 2013, and is primarily directed at the government. The question is this. I understand that the purpose of the administrative action, as you call it in your pleadings of that day, was to check the regularity of the building permits. Now, is it normal practice, and if so, is it provided by law, that in order to check the regularity of a building permit, the building needs to be surrounded by crime scene tape, the administrative authority needs to be supported by police in order to carry out such a check? And if so, why would you say or would you say that that is proportionate in the circumstances of this case? And finally, again to the government, out of fairness, I probably have to ask you this. As you will know, Article 38 of the Convention and Articles 44A and 44C of the rules of court reflect some of the basic requirements for the conduct of a party before a court of law, including this court. These include the duty to cooperate fully in the conduct of the proceedings, the duty to adduce relevant evidence or information, not only when requested, but of its own motion, and the obligation on the member states to furnish all necessary facilities to enable this court to examine the case fully and properly. The rules of court make clear, at the very least, noncompliance with these requirements allows this court to draw such inferences as it deems inappropriate. Now, I noted in preparing for this hearing and during the oral submissions and the applicants positively assert that the government's submissions, in part, provided an incomplete picture of the factual circumstances of this case, and in particular, the domestic proceedings, and in part, so to say, were deliberately misleading, such as in relation to the outright denial, which you make in paragraphs 50 and 51 of your first written pleadings, that decision one of 2013 had, in fact, been appealed, and as we understand it, on a field being confirmed, only for the applicants to produce both the appeal filed, document 26, and the judgment of the Administrative Appeal Court of 2014 in relation to that appeal, document 28. The question is this. If this court were minded to consider whether the government has failed to comply with the obligations I identified at the beginning of this question, and whether, and if so, what inferences to draw from such noncompliance, what submissions not already made would you wish this court to take into account before drawing such inferences? Thank you very much.",
        "476": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have three questions to the government, and then, with your permission, one to the applicants' representatives. The first question, talking of the Supreme Court of Appeal, you assert that the applicants had access to the domestic courts and that their complaints were met, or at least examined, within reasonable time. How do you explain what appears to be a complete inactivity of the Supreme Court since its order suspending the execution of Judgment 269, 2014, of 15 January, 2015, more than two years ago? You assert the complexity of the issues and a necessity to call different experts. How can that justify complete inactivity for more than two years, where there is no even any evidence of the court having ordered, instructed any experts so far, and where it took the Administrative Court of Appeal seven months to consider and decide the appeal against Judgment 3916-2014, despite the fact that it concerned the same issue and also, at least potentially, required the calling of different experts? Second question, as I understand it, Article 142, paragraph 3 of the Albanian Constitution provides that, I quote, state organs must execute judicial decision, end of quote. Would it be correct, therefore, for me to start from the position that, as a matter of national law, an interim order is binding on all state institutions, including the Council of Ministers? You are asking us to conclude that an interim decision, 1 slash 2013, was taken, I quote, in open violation of the law and practice of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court, and turns out to be fictitious, end of quote. On what basis do you say this court, as an international court and compliant with the principle of subsidiarity, is competent to reach such a conclusion, essentially, of domestic law? In any event, did you raise this submission in the appeal against that decision to the Administrative Appeals Court or the Supreme Court? Is it right, as the applicants suggest, that the government's appeal against the interim measure was discontinued by the Administrative Appeals Court in its decision of 20 January 2014 because the subject matter of the dispute had become academic, but that that court expressly confirmed the competence of the First Instance Court to have made the interim order and indicated its view that the breach of that order was unlawful? Third question. Can a decision by the Council of Ministers, de facto, amend a court decision in the Albanian legal system? If not, could you explain what the legal impact of the Council of Ministers' decision of 9 April 2014 is on the merits of the lower Administrative Court decision of 6 March 2014, as far as the compensation amount is concerned? And the final question to the applicants. On the yellow tape, what is your case before this court today? Are you dropping Article 6.2 claim, and are you pleading the yellow tape issue only under Article 8? So, reputation limp, could you please elaborate on this point? Thank you.",
        "477": "Thank you. I would like to ask the government just to clarify in a more detailed manner which were the measures taken against the police official that surrounded the building with the yellow tape. It was already addressed but if you can add some more detail. Thank you.",
        "478": "Thank you. I would have two questions. The first one concerns the question of the transfer of ownership. The government has argued that the transfer of ownership of these properties took place immediately upon the... and by virtue of the Council of Ministers' decision on expropriation on the 27th of November 2013. My question is how does the government reconcile this assertion with the fact that, according to our record, the Council of Ministers' decision, 2015 on the 27th of November provided for the expropriation to be performed within 30 days of the entry into force of this decision by the Council of Ministers? And the second question concerns the movable property. As I understand it, there was a movable property belonging to the applicants which remained in the building and was also destroyed through the demolition. According to the statement of facts that we have, the expropriation order on the 27th of November by the Council of Ministers provided for expropriation of immovable property. So it does not seem that the expropriation decision by the Council of Ministers covered any movable property. So the question is, was there some other legal basis for the loss and destruction of the movable property that was situated in the building and that belonged to the applicants? Thank you.",
        "479": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question to government. So in terms of compensation, as I understand, it is not your case, but in any way, Supreme Court could reduce the compensation payment due to the applicants below the level fixed by Council of Ministers decision. Can you explain why even this level of compensation has not yet been paid to applicants? Thank you.",
        "480": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to ask the applicant the following. The court has invited the parties to reply to a question concerning to what extent the applicant had requested an oral hearing before the council and the Supreme Court. Now, we heard from the government's representative that such a request had been made only in one of the proceedings, the third one. So I would like to ask the applicant whether she confirms this information, that it was only in this one set of proceedings that a request for an oral hearing was made. The second question I would address to the government, we have here a situation where there was no oral hearing at any stage of the proceedings, not before the council and not before the chamber, the competent chamber of the Supreme Court. Is this the regular practice in disciplinary matters that are decided by the council and then decided on appeal at the Supreme Court? And how does the government comment on the applicability of such a situation with the requirements of Article VI?",
        "481": "Just two minor questions to clarify one point. Is it possible to convert fine into a prison term if fine is not paid, if the person is in default in paying the fine? Could it be turned into the prison? And then the effectiveness of remedies. Does the effective remedy exist at the domestic level to challenge independence and impartiality of the body as such, since the composition of the body is defined by the Constitution?",
        "482": "Just one question for better understanding and for information. Before the respective decisions were made, both before the High Council of the Judiciary and the Supreme Court, did the applicant know the composition of these bodies? If she knew them, could she then protest against the respective concrete composition? Thank you.",
        "483": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai deux questions qui s'adressent avant tout aux requ\u00e9rants, mais peut-\u00eatre le gouvernement souhaitera aussi r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions. La premi\u00e8re concerne les modalit\u00e9s pratiques de l'ex\u00e9cution d'un arr\u00eat sur les fonds \u00e0 supposer que les requ\u00e9rants aient pu obtenir un arr\u00eat sur les fonds. Dans quel \u00c9tat sera engag\u00e9e la proc\u00e9dure d'ex\u00e9cution? Quelle serait sa base l\u00e9gale, notamment les trait\u00e9s applicables \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d'ex\u00e9cution? Et quels seraient les effets pratiques de l'ex\u00e9cution d'un tel arr\u00eat? C'est la premi\u00e8re question. La deuxi\u00e8me question concerne un point diff\u00e9rent. Les requ\u00e9rants pr\u00e9sentent par d'un lien entre l'affaire et la Suisse qui rendrait l'article 6 de la Convention applicable. Est-ce que la nature de ces liens s'appr\u00e9cie de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on pour \u00e9tablir la comp\u00e9tence juridictionnelle, la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux, que pour \u00e9tablir aussi la comp\u00e9tence d'un \u00c9tat pour r\u00e9gir des questions de fonds et \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de l'ex\u00e9cution? Et \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles substantielles. Autrement dit, est-ce que la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux suisses est ind\u00e9pendante des questions quels sont les droits substantiels applicables? Elle peut aller au-del\u00e0 du droit suisse substantiel et les tribunaux seraient comp\u00e9tents pour conna\u00eetre le droit civil qui serait r\u00e9gi par le droit d'un autre \u00c9tat? Ou est-ce qu'entre les deux comp\u00e9tences, la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux et la comp\u00e9tence de l'\u00c9tat pour r\u00e9gir les questions de droits mat\u00e9riels, il y a un lien? Est-ce que ces crit\u00e8res de lien entre l'\u00c9tat et les m\u00eames crit\u00e8res pour \u00e9tablir la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux que pour \u00e9tablir la comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9gir les questions de fonds, pour \u00e9dicter les droits mat\u00e9riels? Merci.",
        "484": "Thank you. I have three questions to the parties. First, the Italian aspect context was mentioned by the government. And my question is for both parties, what could be the nature of the claim? It would be the same or the different nature in Italian courts, if the case would be. The next question is about the case law provided by the federal court in its judgment. And also, the government referred to other examples how the Article 3 of the law was applied to the inheritance law, the law of debt enforcement and bankruptcy. My question is whether this article is limited to those property disputes or to family law, or it has more general application in civil cases. And in connection with this case law, if the parties could explain how the elements in those cases were applied in Article 3. I mean the connection to the state, the connection which could be provided by the applicant, by the claimant, by the offender, or the events. So as I understand, and maybe I'm wrong, that there are some foreign elements and domestic elements in those cases. For example, if you give some explanation in relation to one particular category of those cases, for example, debt enforcement. The next question is about the element which was mentioned by the government, not by the applicant. But my question is how the domestic proceedings, the parties and the national authorities assessed or examined that element. I mean that the person who ordered the torture, Mr. A.K., the Minister of Internal Affairs of Tunis, had medical treatment in the Swiss clinic. Does it mean that there could be some connection with the Swiss state, with Switzerland, for example, that the person could have a property or a bank account, how he paid for the services, whether that element was the subject of investigation by the national authorities to establish the connection between the case and the state? And also the question in connection with all these observations made by the applicants, whether the concept of arguable claim or legitimate expectations could be applied in the present case, that what you said about the connection between the applicant and the state. Thank you.",
        "485": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have only one question, which will be addressed to both parties. Could you please comment as to whether the provisions of Article 1 of the Convention, which provides that the high contracted parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section 1 of the Convention, may be relevant in the present case? And if yes, in what way and to what extent? Thank you.",
        "486": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. C'est une question qui s'adresse principalement au gouvernement. Dans l'arr\u00eat litigieux, la Cour de cassation a affirm\u00e9 sans plus d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments la compatibilit\u00e9 du trait\u00e9 d'Ath\u00e8nes avec la Convention europ\u00e9enne des droits de l'homme. Ma question est la suivante. Est-ce qu'il y a d'autres arr\u00eats dans l'ordre juridique h\u00e9l\u00e9nique qui approfondissent cette question de compatibilit\u00e9 entre le trait\u00e9 d'Ath\u00e8nes et la Convention? Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "487": "Thank you, President. I would have three questions. The first question, I understand if our applicant had not been a Muslim but a Christian Orthodox, it would be the same situation as long as she is married to a Muslim. So a mixed marriage would not make a difference. But if you now turn the situation around and the applicant would not be a woman but a man, and she would make a will, and she had also two sisters, so the same situation as we have here but changing the sexes. If she then dies, I understand that the will would probably also be invalid. But what would then be the exact percentage what the husband would inherit? The applicant's lawyer said it would be higher. But I would like to know, would it be? Now it's one quarter. So what exactly would it be? How would it be calculated? My second question is about the role of the notary public. The applicant's lawyer said that there are many wills drafted in front of a notary public in this region. So I understand that the notary public is a legal expert. So doesn't he have a duty to give advice, to say, to inform about the Court of Cassation's jurisprudence holding wills in this way invalid and warning them that this might be the consequence? And could there have been a possibility for designing the inheritance rights in a way that the woman would become 100% heir? And my last question is, so we also have the two sisters in the whole family situation. So I understand these two sisters had a legitimate expectation to be heirs of their brother. So if now the lower court's judgment had become final, what about the legitimate expectation of the sisters? Wouldn't that be also sort of an expropriation concerning their legitimate expectation to become heirs of their brother under Sharia law? Thank you.",
        "488": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I thank the parties for their observations. There seems to be at least an agreement as far as the international treaties, or in particular the Lausanne Treaty, is concerned that it does not mandate the application of sharia law. And also, the Article 43 of the Lausanne Treaty stresses the balance between the respect of minorities on the one hand and the order public on the other hand. And my question is related to the legal certainty in this case, and also to a certain extent to the legitimate expectations. It's more directed to the government, but of course the applicant is also there to answer if she so wishes. The draft law that has been explained by the government and that has been sent very recently to the parliament is there to resolve the uncertainty, as was said also this morning. At the same time, the government argues that the applicant should have known that in her case, the sharia law will apply. So my question is that the government stresses that there was never a reference made to the applicant's own religion in the reasonings of the judgments. However, if I read the judgments, the courts said that it is about succession relations between Muslims, and they have jurisdiction between Muslims, the muftis. So this is, for instance, said also at the Court of Appeal of Trusse, the second judgment after the Supreme Court judgment when the case came back to the appealed court in 2015. So the government says that the plan reformed is to strengthen the protection of the rights of the members of Muslim minority, and mostly women and children. But at the same time, the government says that it is not about the religion or the gender of the applicant. So Judge Nu\u00dfberger has touched upon this, but if the applicant would have been a Greek national of other confession, let's say Greek Orthodox, would then the will of her Muslim husband still be invalid in this case? And also, if and to what point if the late husband would have explicitly withdrawn from the Muslim will, as the government also said, what does it actually mean? Because it's not known to the court that there exist any expressive verbal stipulations in Greek legislation concerning the withdrawal in beforehand from the Muslim will. And are there any case law, is there any case law of the national courts where they have stressed that this is possible, or has this occurred? Because the government also says that the husband had any right, as long as he lived, to transfer validly and duly all his property to his wife. But that would have meant probably to have a gift, to give a gift to his wife or something else. But would have that otherwise also not been covered by the Muslim law if we were taking the jurisprudence of the court of cassation? So this is the question. As far as the second question is concerned, it is about the legitimate expectation. The legitimate expectation on the one hand of the applicant, and on the other hand of the sisters of the deceased husband, and the relation to what I have just asked as a first question concerning the legal certainty and the foreseeability, and concerning the fact that there seems to be not a problem concerning the interpretation of the treaties as such, but interpretation of the treaties by the jurisdictions, by the different jurisdictions. The applicant has in its observations in paragraph 27 said that the sisters had already inherited their parents, their deceased parents, according to the succession rules provided by the civil law. And my question is then about the legitimate expectations of the sisters, because they already had inherited in one case according to the civil law. And what would have been then their expectations, whether in this time it would have been civil law or sharia law that would have been applied? Thank you very much.",
        "489": "Thank you very much. My question perhaps overlaps to some extent some of the previous questions. But I would like to have a clarification from both parties, if possible, regarding the decisive reason why the will was declared invalid. I understand from the Court of Cassation's judgment that the Court of Cassation referred to the category of the property in question, that it was held in full ownership or the mulki type of property. So was this the reason why the will was declared invalid? Or was the reason, did it have to do with who was the beneficiary of the will? I think from the applicant's side, we heard that she lost the inheritance because she was a Muslim wife. So it is not entirely clear to me what was really the reason. Was it the type of property in question? Or was it the question, who was the beneficiary? What if the beneficiary had been someone else, a third person, not a family member at all? Would the will have been valid or invalid? Thank you.",
        "490": "Thank you very much. I have two questions relating to the prohibition of discrimination. The first question is addressed specifically to the government. The government have replied to the questions by the court in two ways. In the first place, they answered with respect to Article 6, taken alone or in combination with Article 14. And in the second place, they argued with respect to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. And the conclusion of the government was that that article is not applicable. And I assume that that is the reason why Article 14 did not come into the discussion. The applicant, however, has also mentioned Article 14 in combination with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. My question to the government is, can we assume that the arguments relating to Article 14, relating to Article 6, would also apply to Article 14 in combination with Article 1, Protocol No. 1, if that latter article would be applicable? And the second question is one to both parties. When we are dealing with discrimination issues, the case law of the court is that a treatment \u2013 a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification. In other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized. We have heard something about the legitimate aim, but not so much about the reasonable relationship of proportionality. Something has been said about it, but I would like to invite the parties to say more how they see this issue of proportionality. Thank you.",
        "491": "Just one, there have been many questions, so I want to pose one question, which is related to the question just posed by Judge Lemmens, and it relates to the applicability of Article I of Protocol I. The applicants are making a claim of discrimination, so they are inviting the court to apply Article XIV in conjunction with Article I of Protocol I. In the pleadings of the parties, both in the applicants' and government's observations, there is a debate on whether there is an adequate recognition at domestic level of any kind of property rights. We're talking about the three-fourths which the applicant loses because of the application of Sharia law. And there is a debate on whether there was a legitimate expectation. May I, however, ask both parties to focus here on a different line of case law, which is in discrimination claims of this sort, we are asking ourselves the court whether but for the condition applied, that is the application of Sharia law, the person in question would have had the benefit afforded to him. So I'm asking you not to focus on, if you may, on whether the property right existed or not, which is one line of case law, but the line of case law in discrimination type cases of property rights, where we're asking ourselves whether the mere fact that a condition has been applied in a discriminatory manner and has limited property rights, therefore, Article I of Protocol I is triggered or applicable. I want to, if you have time during the interval, to look at a case called Fabris versus France, paragraph 52 of that. And I invite you to make a comment on whether that has any bearing on the views of the parties. Thank you.",
        "492": "Sorry, just two short questions. One is, we're here, of course, looking at a complaint under the convention in the context of the Lausanne Treaty and possibly the S\u00e8vres Treaty, the provisions of which are primarily addressed to Turkey on its face, and then, of course, applied in reverse to Greece by Article 45 of the Lausanne Treaty. And I'd like to understand from the parties whether it is right for this court, and if so, how, to have regard to the impact any of our rulings might have on minorities in Turkey, who, of course, bound by both treaties, too. And as I said, if so, how. The second question relates to, ties into the question from Judge Sicilianos. There is an assertion that the interpretation by the Court of Cassation is consistent with the court's case law, and we've heard about Article 6, Article 1 of the first protocol, and Article 14. But I wonder if anybody has given thought to how it is compatible with our case law under Article 9, not forcing the negative right of freedom of religion, which force the right not to practice and reveal one's belief, and the prohibition on states to ask individuals, in this case, the testator, about his or her beliefs and or to force them to follow the tenets of their religion against their choice. I wonder if you could address us on that, please, too.",
        "493": "Thank you very much, President. I would just want to ask a question to the applicant concerning what he told us about the insurance company and the trial, the procedure against the insurance company. So, I understand the complaint was brought on 28th November 2006, so that is two years after the accident. I would like to know, was this insurance obligatory or voluntary? And what exactly was insured? Was it an insurance that covered both the possibility that the applicant was guilty or not guilty in the accident and only the damages, his own damages, or also the damages of the other parties? So, what kind of insurance was it? And why was this complaint brought only in 2006, and that is two years after the accident and not immediately? Thank you.",
        "494": "Merci beaucoup. Je voudrais poser une question sp\u00e9cialement au gouvernement, mais si le requ\u00e9rant peut donner des r\u00e9ponses, je l'appr\u00e9cierai aussi. Le gouvernement nous invite \u00e0 dire que ni l'article 2, ni l'article 3 dans son volet proc\u00e9dural sont applicables dans le cas d'esp\u00e8ce. Mais il a dit quelque part, quand il a plaid\u00e9 la question du traitement, enfin l'absence d'un traitement inhumain ou d\u00e9gradant, que l'esp\u00e8ce pourrait \u00eatre couverte par l'article 8, si j'ai bien compris, l'article 8 dans son volet proc\u00e9dural. Alors, \u00e0 supposer que l'article 8 s'applique, que cet article exige des garanties proc\u00e9durales, quelles seraient alors ces garanties proc\u00e9durales? Est-ce que ces garanties proc\u00e9durales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offertes par le syst\u00e8me roumain? Est-ce dans la proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale ou exclusivement dans la possibilit\u00e9 d'une proc\u00e9dure civile? Merci.",
        "495": "Thank you very much. I have one question for the applicant, really to ask directly why the applicant decided not to bring a civil claim under what I understand was the old Article 998 and 999 of the old civil code for damages in tort against the two drivers allegedly responsible for the accident. The second question I have is for both parties and it's this. In assessing whether remedies have been exhausted, is it relevant for this court to consider the fact that the applicant was a judge and a practicing lawyer for some time and therefore knew or ought to have known what the relevant available remedies and their respective benefits or limitations would be? Thank you very much.",
        "496": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions addressed mainly to the government agent, but of course, the applicant can comment as well. My first question, and I make it quite clear that I put these questions simply so that I can have a very clear picture of the actual situation and the various permutations and combinations that could have occurred in this case. My first question is triggered by something that the government agent said in her presentation. Am I, had, and the question is this, had the applicant appointed a lawyer of his choice, or had he accepted the court-appointed lawyer? Am I correct in saying that the accused, the applicant, of course, in the instant case, could have, at both first instance and on appeal, personally addressed at some stage the courts on issues both of law and of fact, together with or in view of his lawyer? I hope that the question is clear, because there are many sort of conditions. My second question, and again, of course, the applicant is perfectly entitled to comment. Am I correct in understanding that even had the applicant not been suspended as a lawyer because of this alleged incompatibility with his function as an auditor, so even if he had not been suspended, he would still not have been able to represent himself in his trial at both first instance and on appeal? Those are my two questions addressed to most to the government agent, on which, as I said, the applicant is most welcome to comment, as well. Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "497": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question adress\u00e9e avant tout au gouvernement. Le gouvernement, dans ses observations \u00e9crites, parle notamment de recommandations du Comit\u00e9 de droit de l'homme. Je voudrais demander au gouvernement de pr\u00e9senter son point de vue concernant la valeur juridique des recommandations du Comit\u00e9 de droit de l'homme li\u00e9es \u00e0 l'examen d'une requ\u00eate individuelle par ce comit\u00e9. Et notamment, les recommandations du Comit\u00e9 de droit de l'homme ont-elles une valeur contraignante pour les \u00c9tats partis au pacte de droit civil et politique? La deuxi\u00e8me question s'adresse avant tout au requ\u00e9rant. Je voudrais savoir quelles \u00e9taient les principales divergences entre le requ\u00e9rant et son avocat dans le proc\u00e8s qui est \u00e0 l'origine de la requ\u00eate dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Quelles \u00e9taient les divergences, les convergences de vues entre le requ\u00e9rant et son avocat concernant les plaidoiries devant les juridictions nationales? Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "498": "Thank you, Mr. President. The applicant's constitutional appeal to the Constitutional Court was dismissed as inadmissible on 11 May 2012, as it had neither been signed nor endorsed by counsel. Now it's the well-established case law of this Court that domestic remedies are not exhausted if an appeal is dismissed because of the appellant's failure to comply with such formalities. Now, the substantive question before this Court, and that's the \u2013 that's what my colleagues have addressed in their questions, is whether the applicant can claim a right pursuant to the Convention to defend himself in criminal proceedings. And I underline criminal proceedings. But this substantive legal question is arguably distinct from the requirement in Portuguese law that a constitutional appeal on whatever legal question be signed by legal counsel. And this distinction is highlighted by Sir Nigel Rodley in his separate opinion, which is attached to the Human Rights Committee decision, and I quote, Important as it may be to ensuring justice in an individual case, a constitutional motion is not procedurally an integral part of a criminal trial. In the light of these factors, and also our established case law, I would ask both parties to explain if domestic remedies have actually been exhausted in this case, and if so, how.",
        "499": "J'aurais une question au requ\u00e9rant. J'aimerais bien savoir, le requ\u00e9rant a d\u00e9j\u00e0 port\u00e9 une requ\u00eate devant la Cour en 1999, et la Cour a rendu un jugement en 2001, et ce jugement est d\u00e9finitif, alors c'\u00e9tait la m\u00eame chose, le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me, maintenant c'est 16 ann\u00e9es plus tard, et j'aimerais bien savoir quels sont les changements ou bien les facteurs que vous comptez importants pour justifier un revirement de notre jurisprudence. Merci.",
        "500": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have two questions. One will be addressed to the government and the other to the applicant. First to the government, according to paragraph 36 of your grand chamber observations, it is the overriding interest of justice and effective defense of defendants that legitimize provisions of code of criminal procedure on compulsory representation. You, in your pleadings today, have outlined some of those interests that you deem important. But could you please specify whether such interests of justice existed in the particular applicant's case? And in particular, could he be considered to be unable to defend himself effectively in the particular case? And if so, why? Then a question to the applicant. The question might be similar to what Judge De Gaetano already forwarded, namely, in what way, if at all, did the appointment of a counsel impede the applicant to conduct your own defense? And in particular, what procedural action were you prevented from undertaking, if any? And in case of possible divergent views between you and your counsel, could your views prevail over those of your counsel? Of course, the government is also welcome to comment on this last issue.Thank you very much.",
        "501": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai une question \u00e0 poser \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante. Si le gouvernement voulait commenter, \u00e7a sera bien aussi. Donc, la requ\u00e9rante avait fait une demande aupr\u00e8s de notre cour qui ne se fonde pas sur la question de la discrimination. Ca veut dire sur l'article 14. On voit maintenant qu'\u00e0 nouveau, en voquant aussi les observations de la terre intervenante, la requ\u00e9rante souhaiterait que la cour requalifie l'affaire \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape en vertu du principe Iura novit curia et prend en consid\u00e9ration une \u00e9ventuelle violation de l'article 14. La question que j'aimerais vous poser, c'est si vous voyez cette possible requalification en vertu d'une discrimination en direct vu que les personnes qui sont vis\u00e9es sont des personnes qui vivent de prestations sociales ou des personnes qui sont dans des cat\u00e9gories peut-\u00eatre ethniques diff\u00e9rentes de la majorit\u00e9 aux Pays-Bas, ou il s'agit d'une discrimination directe vu la pauvret\u00e9 de Mme Garib. Ca, c'est ma premi\u00e8re question. Ma deuxi\u00e8me question s'adresse au gouvernement. Dans votre m\u00e9moire, le gouvernement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un avis consultatif de 1950 de la Cour internationale de justice concernant l'admission de certains Etats pour nous dire que la Cour n'a pas besoin de r\u00e9courir \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 2 du paragraphe 4 aux travaux pr\u00e9paratoires. Que il suffit pour nous de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9raire de l'article 2. Et ma question est la suivante. Est-ce que vous pensez qu'\u00e0 ce stade-l\u00e0, dans la jurisprudence de la Cour, est-ce que vous pouvez nous donner des exemples? La Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 clarifi\u00e9 les notions d'ordre public ou d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, parce que vous dites qu'on doit appliquer le paragraphe 4. Si la Cour est suffisamment claire, si on a une jurisprudence claire concernant l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, et par cons\u00e9quent, on ne doit pas faire la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux moyens compl\u00e9mentaires d'interpr\u00e9tation des trait\u00e9s, \u00e7a veut dire, vu l'article 32 de la Convention de Vienne, vu les travaux pr\u00e9paratoires. Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "502": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to ask a question about something that has been raised by the applicant, also at the hearing, and something that is explicitly addressed in the written observations of the government in paragraph 80. It is about the fact that the applicant was already living in the area and, as she says, was in fact applying for a permit to live somewhere else around the corner. The act, as has been explained, is intended to avoid over-concentration of people with certain characteristics in designated areas. The fact that this person is already living in that area and is asking to seek a place in the same area, how does that fit within the whole aim of the law? Because moving in the same area is not going to increase the concentration. There is some difficulty for me in seeing how it fits the purpose that has been emphasized by the government here.",
        "503": "Thank you Mr. President. I have three questions to the government, but of course the applicant can also express her views on this issue. The first question relates to the motivation of the law. It is explicit from the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of this law and explicitly mentioned in the explanatory memorandum of this law. And I'm quoting from a part of the chamber's judgment that these together with antisocial behavior, the influx of illegal immigrants and crime was said to constitute the core of Rotterdam's problems. So antisocial behavior, influx of illegal immigrants and crime. And this was one of the replies to these problems. So my question to the government is the following. Is there any statistical evidence of results of this housing policy in terms of reduction of antisocial behavior, crime, drugs-related nuisance, vandalism? Is there any evidence in terms of statistics that can prove the effectiveness of this law to combat these hills of Rotterdam? The second question is related to the duration of this measure. The measure is now in place since 2006, 10 years have passed. The burgomaster of Rotterdam has a plan, an housing plan, housing program until 2030, which includes this measure. We know that this program was refused in a local referendum. But my question now is the following. Until when will this housing policy last? How many more years will it be applied? And the third and final question regards the position of the government vis-a-vis other international bodies which have already dealt with this situation, namely the Human Rights Committee within the United Nations and the European Committee of Social Rights, which have expressed their views explicitly on this law. The Human Rights Committee in 2009 said the following. The committee is concerned that this law may result in violations of Articles 12, Paragraph 1, and 26 of the Covenant. The European Committee of Social Rights in 2011 expressed a similar view, a similar concern, and invited the government to produce evidence that there was no discrimination, and concluded that there will be nothing to show that the situation is in conformity with Article 31, Paragraph 1 of the European Social Charter as regards effective access to and enjoyment of adequate housing in case the government did not produce this evidence. My question is the following. What was the reply of the government to these two international evaluations, one performed by the Human Rights Committee in 2009 and the other by the European Committee of Social Rights in 2011? Thank you very much.",
        "504": "Thank you, Mr. President. May I ask the government to clarify the aim of this measure? I understand from your presentation that it was primarily about desegregation or integration. But in the various documents which were submitted or were considered to be the basis of the measure, there might be an alternative explanation, namely that this was about combating antisocial behavior, which was just quoted by my colleague. So I just would like to have a clarification. Now, assuming that the aim is legitimate, was there a less intrusive means to achieve that goal, whatever goal it is? And this question is to both parties. Was there a less intrusive means to achieve the aim of this measure? Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "505": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question to both parties. It concerns the Gendarmerie unit, which carried out the investigation under the prosecutor's supervision. I would like to have some more information about the statute of this Gendarmerie investigative unit. It's stated within the armed forces, and the relationship, the links between this investigative unit and the military unit, which guarded the industrial site belonging to this private oil company. Were there any institutional links, any personal links? And was there any joint command for both the investigative unit and the guarding unit? Thank you.",
        "506": "Oui, merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai des questions, surtout au gouvernement, tout d'abord. \u00c0 la suite de l'arr\u00eat du 18 octobre 2009 de la Cour constitutionnelle, qui concerne l'al\u00e9ation de certaines dispositions de la loi sur les juges militaires, apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour constitutionnelle, quelles sont les normes depuis lors concernant les questions de l'impr\u00e9pendance et l'impartialit\u00e9 des juges militaires, \u00e0 part la pr\u00e9sence d'un officier, ce n'est pas le cas d'un officier si\u00e9geant au sein du tribunal militaire. C'est une autre d\u00e9cision. Ma deuxi\u00e8me question concerne les procureurs militaires. En ce qui concerne les procureurs militaires, quelles sont les normes l\u00e9gales et administratives \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de leur fichier de l'appr\u00e9ciation d'officier? Cet fichier est \u00e9tabli par le sup\u00e9rieur hi\u00e9rarchique. Ensuite, je veux poser aussi trois questions concernant l'enqu\u00eate. Premi\u00e8rement, est-ce que les procureurs militaires sont tenus d'informer officiellement les proches de la victime ou de leur avocat de l'ouverture, du d\u00e9roulement et de la cl\u00f4ture d'une enqu\u00eate p\u00e9nale? Et si c'est le cas, \u00e0 quel moment pr\u00e9cis et sur quelle base doivent-ils le faire? Deuxi\u00e8mement, toujours dans le m\u00eame cadre, alors quelles sont les r\u00e8gles et les formalit\u00e9s concernant l'acc\u00e8s aux pi\u00e8ces de dossier d'une telle enqu\u00eate par les proches de la victime ou bien s\u00fbr de leur avocat? Est-ce qu'il y a des situations o\u00f9 pareil acc\u00e8s est restreint ou interdit? Et si c'est le cas, pour quels motifs et sur quelle base l\u00e9gal? Et troisi\u00e8mement, cette question concerne aussi les requ\u00e9rants. Est-ce que pendant une enqu\u00eate en cours, les proches de la victime ou leur avocat sont habilit\u00e9s \u00e0 participer efficacement, par exemple, en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 la r\u00e9interrogation des t\u00e9moins ou \u00e0 l'examen des \u00e9l\u00e9ments mat\u00e9riels ou demandant des expertises ou contre-expertises pertinentes? Voil\u00e0, ce sont mes questions au parties. Merci beaucoup.",
        "507": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question refers to the one posed by Judge Karaka\u015f. As I understand, the Constitutional Court ruling of 18th October 2009 established that the lack of independence of judges in military courts affected all the judges in these courts as they depended for their promotion to the favorable opinions and report of superior military officers or judges. It seems also that the prosecutors at the time were subject to the same requisites for promotion as military judges. However, in this Constitutional Court ruling, there was not a direct pronouncement on the independence of prosecutors. However, later, a law of 12 May 2012 suppressed the requisites for promotion of favorable opinion reports both for judges and for prosecutors. Then my question is for both parties, because I think it would be of interest, did the ruling of the Constitutional Court of October 2009 imply not only the lack of independence of military judges, but also, taking into account the posterior legislation, if implied also the lack of independence of military prosecutors? I would appreciate some comments on this point. Thank you.",
        "508": "Thank you. Just a minor point of clarification, if I could ask counsel for the applicants. In connection with this application which was brought before the Supreme Military Administrative Court, is it the applicant's contention, if I understood correctly, that this application for a remedy was brought without their knowledge by someone else? If I understood the submission by Ms. Butler correctly, or has any follow-up, have the applicants followed this up to see what actually happened in this particular instance? I would welcome some clarification on this point. This, of course, relates to the question of admissibility. Thank you.",
        "509": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question to the applicants. It's a question on the clarification of the scope of their legal arguments. They say on paragraph 16 in their observations, the Grand Chamber, and I quote, should look to the standards associated with Article VI in order to judge the sufficiency of the investigation when considering an alleged violation of the procedural component of Article II. I want to ask, does the applicant argue that the standards that you refer to, are they both standards as regards to what we can call formal or regulatory independence? Or are they also or mainly dealing with the criteria of impartiality? That's the first one. Are the applicants also here inviting the court to apply these standards associated with Article VI only in cases where there is a possibility of judicial review of investigatory measures in the member states, which is not always the case? Or is this argument of a general application? So then these independence and impartiality requirements would be directed at investigatory authorities, not of a judicial nature. And lastly, is the applicant's argument limited to the military context? Or is it an argument that has general application in all instances where the procedural component is triggered by a death in the member states? Thank you. Thank you.",
        "510": "Thank you Mr. President. Only one question and affirmation that somehow has struck me both to both parties. I understand, we know that Azerbaijan is a country which is a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights. It's bound by it. Armenia is also a signatory of the European Convention. Now, looking at Nagorno-Karabakh, if Nagorno-Karabakh were a separate, independent state, not being a signatory of the European Convention, would be the European Convention applicable, will be enforced, will be the rights recognized by the European Convention enforced in the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh? In this case, if it were not bound by the Convention, what would be the relevance of Article 35 of the Convention for the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh for this case?",
        "511": "Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is indeed on jurisdiction, since in the pleadings just now, we heard all three parties indeed discussing at lens this issue. And I would really appreciate if the applicants, the respondent government and the third party, if you wish so, clarified your point. And the point you were making is the following. You were drawing comparison with the ICJ's judgment in the Nicaragua case, followed up by indeed, as mentioned, by the genocide case. And you were suggesting that in fact, this court has taken a different approach as compared to the one taken by the ICJ in the Nicaragua case. I would be much obliged if you gave an indication, one or two elements with reference to Ila\u015fcu or Loizidou cases. Where do you see exactly that this court has in fact departed from the ICJ's approach as concerns test of responsibility? And secondly, I have a small question for the applicants. If you could very briefly answer, the question goes to Article One of Protocol One. Is your submission in fact, that there is a specific and identifiable administrative, executive or legislative act or action attributable to the respondent government which has prevented the applicants that you represent from accessing their houses, which are these acts or actions? Or in fact, your submission is, under Article One of Protocol One, that the respondent state is under a positive obligation to adopt policies, legislation, et cetera, that would enable the applicants to access their houses. Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "512": "Thank you, President. I have a question to the respondent government, something that the learned representative said, which I didn't understand, and maybe I'm overlooking something. I would be glad for clarification. The respondent government said that the applicants did not exhaust domestic remedies available to them in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and in Armenia. Now, the applicants had their property in Lachin, occupied by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, that is undisputed. So I can understand if you are claiming that the applicants should have gone before the courts of Nagorno-Karabakh. But you also said that they should have gone before the Armenian courts. And I just have one quote here, which the learned representative said, lawyers and judges in Armenia are waiting to process these claims, end of quote. Here I'm confused, puzzled. What do Armenian courts have to do with the Lachin area, occupied by Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, where the applicants have their property? How could Armenian courts have provided legal redress to the applicants? Maybe I've overlooked something, and I'll be grateful if you could clarify. Thank you, President.",
        "513": "Thank you, President. Three questions, all addressed to the respondent government, and all regarding non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. First, can the government solemnly guarantee to this court that the statement of the Lachin judge with regard to the admissibility of claims of property by people of Azeri and Kurdish origin are still valid today? Second, two cases were referred by the respondent government of restoration of property to Azerbaijani IDPs. And I went through the old file, and I cannot remember to have read any reference to these two cases. I would be grateful for clarification with regard to the date when these judgments were delivered, by which court, and if these two judgments are yes or no final. Third question, is there any legal provision in the NKR prohibiting or expropriating ownership of land or other property by people of Azeri or Kurdish origin? We know what the so-called Constitution of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic says, but is there any additional legislation which directly prohibits or indirectly prohibits or expropriates ownership of land or other property of IDPs from Azeri or Kurdish origin? Thank you.",
        "514": "Thank you, President. I have questions for both parties. First, three questions for the applicant. Is it the applicant's case that the highly respected judges, ministers, and lawyers of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh are lying in their witness statements? If so, will you please point out the lies or false statements that you allege? This is the first question. And second question, as you mentioned, the applicant's lawyers admit that they have no experience with Armenian or Nagorno-Karabakh law. Why didn't the applicants seek help from lawyers with such an experience? And my third question, as we know, your government has adopted so-called blacklist of foreigners who visited NKR. My question would be, could their own citizens freely travel to NKR without fear that they will be punished by their own government? We had the case before this court, Eynulla Fatullayev, in which we know that the applicant was punished for his visits to Nagorno-Karabakh and for his articles concerning Nagorno-Karabakh. Now my questions to the government. Our first question concerns the passports. In which cases a resident of, in which concrete cases, a resident of Nagorno-Karabakh can be issued with a passport of the Republic of Armenia? And do you have any figures how many of them have been issued with it? My second question may be not too much related to today's deliberation, because as court decided in his admissibility decision, we will be considering facts after ratification of convention. But in any way, what would be your comments on the statement of Vazgen Manukyan, who was Armenian defense minister in October 1992, and who made statement in 2000 about union of armies in Gaia and Armenia, which is mentioned in the book Thomas De Waal, Black Garden, referred by applicants. And also, more concrete question, could you explain how it was possible that the Armenian law enforcement agents operated in the case of Zalian and others in Nagorno-Karabakh and the regional, Sunni regional court of Armenia hold the hearing in Stepanakert? And my last question, could you please compare the financial support which Nagorno-Karabakh gets from all Armenian fund and from other sources, namely from the government of the United States? Thank you.",
        "515": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question for the applicants, and third-party interveners may respond if they so choose. The Applicants' Council cited paragraph 56 of this court's judgment in Loizidou v. Turkey. It's important of the submission that the effective control test does not necessitate a demonstration of detailed control over the policies and actions of local authorities in the disputed area. In paragraph 56 of Loizidou, the court stated, and I quote, it is not necessary to determine whether, as the applicant and the government of Cyprus have suggested, Turkey actually exercises detailed control over the policies and actions of the authorities of the TRC. It is obvious from the large number of troops engaged in active duties in northern Cyprus that her army exercises effective control over that part of the island. Such control, according to the relevant test and in the circumstances of the case, entails her responsibilities for the policies and actions of the TRC. In Al-Skeini, the court elaborated further, stating that the factual assessment of jurisdiction must be, and I quote from paragraphs 138 to 139, primarily based on the strength of the military's presence, as mentioned by counsel to the third-party intervener. My question on this basis is, I would kindly ask the applicants to explain as concretely as possible what they consider to be their strongest pieces of evidence from which the court would be able to draw sufficiently strong, clear, and concordant inferences as to the responding government's strength of its military presence in Nakorno-Karabakh in general and in Lachia in particular. Thank you.",
        "516": "Merci, monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai 2 questions pour les repr\u00e9sentants du gouvernement suisse. La 1re question. Dans le cadre du coop\u00e9ration Dublin, quelle est, en pratique, la forme et l'\u00e9tendue des r\u00e9ponses pour la prise en charge des demandeurs d'asile de la part de l'Etat requis? Est-ce qu'elle se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la situation sp\u00e9cifique des demandeurs d'asile, aux conditions sp\u00e9cifiques d'accueil, etc.? La 2e question. Quelle est la proportion entre, d'une c\u00f4t\u00e9, les prises en charge explicites \u00e0 la base de l'article 22, paragraphe 1 du r\u00e8glement Dublin 3, et de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, de la prise en charge implicite \u00e0 la base du paragraphe 7 du m\u00eame article du r\u00e8glement Dublin 3? Est-ce que les Etats requis r\u00e9agissent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ou la pratique, c'est plut\u00f4t l'acceptation implicite? Je vous remercie.",
        "517": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to the respondent government. I would appreciate if you responded on this issue concerning the best interests of the child. And in particular, the question is, in what manner have the Swiss authorities taken into consideration the best interests of the child within the proceedings that we are dealing with today in the framework of the case? And would the position of the Swiss government be that essentially the considerations of the best interests of the child within the Dublin system lie with the government who receives the asylum seekers in this case? Italy? Or would you consider that depending on where you are in the proceedings, there is a difference in how much the Swiss authorities could consider the principle of the best interests of the child? Thank you.",
        "518": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai deux questions aux repr\u00e9sentants du gouvernement suisse. La premi\u00e8re, est-ce que les autorit\u00e9s suisses \u00e9taient, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, quand l'expulsion \u00e9tait pendante, conscientes que les autorit\u00e9s responsables en Belgique et en Allemagne ne permettaient plus l'expulsion de demandeurs d'asile vers l'Italie dans plusieurs cas pour les craintes qu'il y a des d\u00e9fauts syst\u00e9matiques dans le syst\u00e8me d'asile, notamment concernant les accords d'accommodation? Deuxi\u00e8me question. Est-ce que les autorit\u00e9s suisses \u00e9taient conscientes, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, quand l'expulsion \u00e9tait pendante, du fait que les familles expuls\u00e9es vers l'Italie risquent \u00e0 \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9es? Un risque bien d\u00e9montr\u00e9 dans plusieurs rapports des ONG, une pratique qui, selon les ONG, est de nature syst\u00e9matique. Cela veut dire que dans certaines r\u00e9gions en Italie, les familles sont s\u00e9par\u00e9es syst\u00e9matiquement. Merci.",
        "519": "Thank you very much. I do have a question to the applicant. It's a clarification question. On 21st of June, the file was removed from Judge M and the case was withdrawn from the judge. On 6th of September, the applicant wrote the letter to the Minister of Justice calling for investigation by General Inspectorate of Judicial Services. And then, the day after, 7th of September, the applicant went to public before waiting for decision of the Minister. If you be so kind and clarify, what was the reason and the aim you decided to go to public and how your public intervention made three months after the case was withdrawn from Judge M? How this contributed to the proper administration of justice? Moreover, in circumstances when there was going on the investigation on Judge M's professional behaviour. Thank you.",
        "520": "Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais faire une demande d'information au parti. Est-ce qu'il y a des r\u00e8glements ou des r\u00e9gulations disciplinaires internes de l'ordre des avocats qui pourraient \u00e9ventuellement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 appli\u00e9es par des organes de l'ordre au fait du cas? En d'autres mots, est-ce qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d'introduire une telle proc\u00e9dure disciplinaire contre les r\u00e9currents dans le cas, dehors et s\u00e9par\u00e9ment de la proc\u00e9dure judiciaire? Dans le cas, comment doit-on s'interpr\u00e9ter qu'on n'a pas introduit une telle proc\u00e9dure? Merci.",
        "521": "Merci. I would like to put a question to the applicant's lawyers. Two questions, actually. During your submissions this morning, you emphasized the fact, I think, that the character of the particular judge in question, Judge M, was not an issue in the freedom of expression enjoyed by the applicant, and that it was only her professional conduct that was commented upon. I would like you to elaborate on that submission in respect solely of the allegation of connivance. I'm not interested, for the purposes of the question, in the first part of the allegation, but on the allegation of connivance, particularly when we hear from the government's lawyers that this could involve the criminal liability on the part of the judge in question. So, could you elaborate on how the character of Judge M was not an issue in circumstances where an allegation of connivance, which could involve criminal liability, was made? That's the first question. And the second question I would like some further submissions on is on the question of the duty of a lawyer. You focus, again, primarily on the lawyer's primary role to defend his or her client's interests. And you submit that the lawyer must enjoy a functional protection not limited to the courtroom, and that it be as broad as possible. I would be interested in any observations that you might have to make on the lawyer's duty, if any, in your view, to the court. And in this regard, I mean the court actually seized with the case, the court hearing the case, and not to the professional reputation of judges in general. I'm talking about the court that was actually seized with the hearing of this case at the time when the comments were made. What, if any, in your view, does... What duty, if any, in your view, does such a lawyer owe to the court as the decider of the facts and the law? Thank you.",
        "522": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for the government that I would like to present. The government observes that paragraph 52 of their observations, and I quote, the applicant has failed to substantiate any claim that the Iranian authorities would have any special interest in him. I would like to ask as clearly as possible, what does the government consider to be the evidentiary weight or significance in this respect of the written summons by the Revolutionary Court presented to the applicant that he should attend Evin Prison in Teheran on 2 November 2009? And I would here like to refer to the applicant's contention here that the Migration Court, and this is paragraph 83 of the applicant's observations, that the Migration Court expressed no doubt as to the validity of F.G.'s summons to attend the Revolutionary Court on 2 November 2009. And I put this question to the government in light of the fact that the government considers that it has not been demonstrated that the Iranian authorities have a special interest in the applicant. My second question deals with the conclusion, which is I think the crux of this case, the government contends that paragraph 57 and the counsel for the government reiterated this today. The government concludes that the applicant has not plausibly demonstrated that he would, on account of his conversion to Christianity, face a real risk of being subjected to ill treatment. Does this conclusion, because I didn't quite understand this issue, does this conclusion apply not only to the facts as established in 2011 and 12 by the migration authorities at domestic level? Or is it also the government's submission today that were the Grand Chamber to decide the issue in accordance with the materials submitted as of this date, the applicant has not made such a plausible claim? I would like an answer to that. Thank you.",
        "523": "Thank you. I have a question for the applicant. In a written statement to the court on the 13th of September this year, the applicant states that his family can never accept the fact that he has converted and that his friends will never tolerate it. In view of this, does the applicant consider that there is a potential risk that his family and friends will find out about his conversion should he practice it in Iran by way of, for instance, publications of religious texts on the internet or being active in a church? And if they did find out about it, what could be the consequences for the applicant in his relations with them? I also have a question for the government. In order to better understand how familiar the Swedish authorities and courts are with the situation of Christian converts in Iran, I would like to know if the government know how common it is that Iranian asylum seekers invoke surplus conversions as a ground of asylum in Sweden.",
        "524": "Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. I have first a factual clarification. Referring to paragraph 41 of the chamber judgment and then to the conclusion, paragraph 42 of the chamber judgment, my understanding is that the applicant failed to raise or did not prefer to raise the question of his conversion, whereas today the government is alleging that he failed to substantiate. And I see a nuance between these two positions. Then my second point would go to a reference, and I apologize for this, is a reference to yesterday's judgment of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, a judgment of the grand chamber of that court. And the court says in paragraph 56, I quote, I'm sorry, in French, if the Member States consider that it normally belongs to the applicant to present all the necessary elements to support his request, this is more than just providing elements of nature to establish his own sexual orientation, in that case, a religious orientation in this case, it is no less important that it is up to the concerned Member State to cooperate with this applicant at the stage of determining the relevant elements of this request, in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1 of the Directive 2004-83. So my question is, what would be the impact of this interpretation for this case? And then my final question, Mr. President, this court, since the early cases of Cruz Varas, Chahal, etc., I might refer as well to Sufi and Elmi, paragraph 215, has used the notion of ex-nunc analysis, to which Judge Spano, if I understood well, referred to. Does this kind of analysis take place at national level as well? So do the national authorities take into account the current circumstances, not only of the destination state, but also of the applicant? Thank you.",
        "525": "Thank you, Mr. President. One question for the applicant, and one question for the government. Starting with the government. The applicant was a Muslim, and he converted to Christian belief. This is a crime in Iran, and a very serious crime. It's a crime of apostasy. And it's a capital offense, punished with death. Iran punishes with death penalty those Muslim who convert to other beliefs. More recently, prosecutors have relied on other offenses, such as an attempt to the security of the state, which is also a capital offense. My question is the following. Can the government guarantee today to this plenary that if there is a new assessment of the applicant's situation at the national level, he's not going to be sent to a country where he faces the death penalty? I repeat, in the case the court finds eventually only a procedural violation of Article Two or Three, and the new procedure is launched at the national level, can the government guarantee today that this person, at the end of the day, at the end of that national proceeding, will not be sent to a country where he faces the death penalty? My question to the applicant. What has been the practical contribution of the applicant to his church? We have heard today that he leads a Bible studies group, that he has provided help with the church's website. Is there any other additional practical help that he has been willing to give to the church? What kind of contribution does he give to the life of his church? Could you please elaborate further on this practical life as a Christian of the applicant? Thank you very much.",
        "526": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is addressed to the government and follows in a sense from Judge Spano's question. Apart from what the applicant did or did not do before the domestic tribunals, and apart from what the domestic tribunals concluded, I would like to know, because I'm still not quite sure what the answer to this question is, what is the government's position today? Is it of the view that the applicant is a real convert to Christianity, or is it of the view that this was not a genuine conversion, but simply possibly a means to an end? That is the question I would like to know. What is the government's view today on this point? Thank you.",
        "527": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to the representative of the applicant, in particular to Ma\u00eetre Paoletti. Did I understand the facts correctly that our applicant never asked for an in vitro fertilization after her partner has died? Did I understand it correctly that she never wished to pursue the pregnancy because she didn't want to become a single mother? My second question concerns also the applicant. Did the applicant receive, before she went into in vitro fertilization treatment, a contract by the hospital in which she was informed about the fact that the embryos created by in vitro fertilization could only be used for the fertilization, but not for anything else? Thank you.",
        "528": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je m'adresse aux deux parties pour leur demander si pourrait-elle nous donner son point de vue sur deux aspects moins scientifiques et plus techniques pour moi. Le premier \u00e9tant, quel est votre point de vue sur l'applicabilit\u00e9 de l'article 8 de la Convention au fait de l'affaire qui est pr\u00e9sente devant nous. Et le deuxi\u00e8me point, d'une certaine fa\u00e7on li\u00e9 au premier, sur la qualit\u00e9 des victimes de la requ\u00e9rante. Merci.",
        "529": "Thank you, Mr. President. My questions are partly overlapping the questions which were already raised. My first question is, what was the legal system applicable in 2003 when the embryos were created concerning conservation and, in particular, research in Italy? Secondly, it is argued by government that embryo is life. My question is this, assuming that you are right and this is life, is it a life comparable to that of the fetus? Is the in vitro embryo that was called a cluster of cells by Professor De Luca, is this entity, a person, in view of Italian law, having regard to the position of the Constitutional Court which said in 75, \"persona che deve ancora diventare\"? To the applicants, if I understand correctly, the in vitro entity is 11 years old. Is there any research advantage to use these cells for research purposes given the age and given the doubts expressed? To the government, is an Italian scientist subject to criminal prosecution if he or she carries out research abroad on in vitro embryo? Thank you very much.",
        "530": "Oui, merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. J'aimerais que le gouvernement clarifie le but l\u00e9gitime de l'interdiction de l'article 13 de la loi 40 2004, tout en consid\u00e9rant que les laboratoires peuvent pratiquer des recherches sur les lignes embryonnaires import\u00e9es de l'\u00e9tranger, donc apr\u00e8s la destruction de ces embryons. D'apr\u00e8s cela, j'ai une question plus simple. Est-ce qu'il y a une interdiction de destruction des embryons? \u00c7a, on le sait, mais que devient-il s'il existe une interdiction? Alors, est-ce que les institutions gardent \u00e0 l'infini? C'est ma deuxi\u00e8me question. Merci beaucoup.",
        "531": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have one question to the representative of the applicants. It's a factual question. Is the applicant obliged to maintain contacts with the embryo storage bank whilst her embryos are cryopreserved? For instance, should she still pay for cryopreservation of her embryo? Thank you.",
        "532": "This question goes to the government. I would like to know if there is any available data on the number of sterile couples who have benefited from fertilization with cryopreserved embryos of third couples who did not want to become parents. Do we have already any available data on these third couples who have benefited from this possibility? Thank you.",
        "533": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for both parties. As we saw from hearing, the main purpose and object of the law from 2004 is to protect the life of the embryo. In this context, is there any, I would say, internal inconsistency or contradiction concerning this main object of the law? I mean, in any case, embryo will be extinct, will be perished after the lapse of some time. Or more precisely, whether the holding embryo in cryopreserved status on the temperature absolute zero amounts also some sort of scientific experiment. And the second question is whether the prohibition of scientific research is motivated by other reason, not only to protect the life of the embryo. Thank you.",
        "534": "Thank you, President. My question is of a philosophical nature, and I would like both parties to comment on the philosophical underpinnings of each other's submissions. If I understand correctly, the submission of the government is founded upon a philosophical understanding of the embryo as a value in itself under Italian law, that the embryo is the subject of rights or is a value in itself, an end in itself. And if I understand correctly, the submissions of the applicant, the embryo, or as Professor De Luca has put it, may be seen as a cluster of cells, that this entity, this embryo or cluster of cells, may become a value for others. So not necessarily an end in itself, but perhaps a means towards some other end. And you mentioned some of the types of research and benefits that can accrue from the research on embryos. So I would like each side to consider the philosophical underpinning in terms of value, means end, and comment on the correlation of each party's position with the rights protected under Article 8 of the Convention. Thank you.",
        "535": "Mr. President, I have first a question to the applicants' councils. And in view of the submissions that we just heard, I would really appreciate if you explained more specifically your key submission that resort to equivalent protection doctrine, as developed by the court in the Bosphorus case, leads to a harmonization or harmonious application of the obligations, both that derive under Security Council resolution concerns and Article 6. And that in light of Article 103 of the charter, if I understood your key submission correctly. And I would like to really know how do you envisage this construction applied in practice in the facts of the case? Do you mean that the domestic tribunals are not prevented from assessing the well-founded character of the listing of the applicant? And if so, if the well-founded character were to assess, what would be then the expected outcome at the domestic level? And second question goes to the parties. And it concerns Article 6, because we've had submissions on the scope of the court's competence, \"ratione personae and ratione materiae\". But I would like you to answer a very simple question, and that is applicability of Article 6. We know that for Article 6 to apply, we have to have a civil rights in dispute or a criminal charge. So which aspect, in fact, do you plead, I suppose, the applicant or do you contest as far as the respondent government is concerned? And what case law do you invoke in support of the applicability? Thank you. resident.",
        "536": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. La 1re question va \u00e0 la partie requ\u00e9rante. Vous avez parl\u00e9 d'int\u00e9gration syst\u00e9mique et d'application harmonieuse des obligations parall\u00e8les, non pas contradictoires, mais parall\u00e8les, de la Suisse au titre de la charte de la Convention. Dans ce contexte, et \u00e0 votre avis, quel aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre concr\u00e8tement l'\u00e9tendue du contr\u00f4le de la part des juridictions suisses? Le tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aurait d\u00fb s'assurer simplement que l'inscription du requ\u00e9rant sur la liste n'\u00e9tait pas fausse ou arbitraire, ou bien le tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aurait d\u00fb op\u00e9rer un contr\u00f4le d'opportunit\u00e9 de la mesure d'inscription et partant des mesures de gel et de confiscation des avoirs? La 2e question, M. le Pr\u00e9sident, va au gouvernement, et \u00e9ventuellement au gouvernement intervenant. Tous les gouvernements ici pr\u00e9sents ont parl\u00e9, ont vu dans l'article 103 de la charte des Nations unies une r\u00e8gle de conflit de normes. Donc d'un conflit entre la charte et la Convention. S'agit-il r\u00e9ellement d'une r\u00e8gle de conflit de normes ou bien plus simplement d'une r\u00e8gle de conflit d'obligations? La Commission du droit international, dans son rapport sur la fragmentation du droit international mentionn\u00e9 tout \u00e0 l'heure, pr\u00e9cise dans le paragraphe 331 du rapport, l'article 103 ne pr\u00e9cise pas que la charte prime, mais renvoie aux obligations en vertu de la charte. Donc l'article 103, d'apr\u00e8s vous, est une r\u00e8gle de conflit de normes ou simplement de conflit d'obligations? Merci beaucoup.",
        "537": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions, one for the applicant, which is the first one. The government refers at paragraphs 58 to 64 to the court's case law on the limitation to the right of access to court under Article 6.1 in the state immunity cases, Al-Adsani versus UK, and recently the fourth section's judgment in Jones versus UK, where the limitation is based on a recognized norm of international law. The government here refers also to the dissenting opinion view by Judge Lorenzen, where he states, and I quote \"Priority for implementing binding resolutions of the UN Security Council can be said to belong to this category of exceptions\". I see from the applicant's submissions in written form, and also today, that towards this argument, an argument has not been made. So may I ask the applicants to explain to the court, assuming the applicability of Article 6, how would the applicant invite the court to distinguish the rule of priority under Article 103 of the UN Charter as regards binding resolutions of the Security Council and the case law on this aspect? My second question goes to the government. The government states at paragraph 49 of its observations that, and it considers that the court cannot find, and this is, I'm quoting the observation, that there has been a violation independently of the concrete and realistic feasibility of implementation of the obligations that such a finding would entail. This is the English translation. May I ask the government to develop this or explain this a bit in taking two things into account which are part of the facts of this case. Number one, as the government mentioned, the government has itself allowed for exceptions to the freezing of these funds, and it has done so under the Iraq ordinance, which was promulgated by Switzerland, where exceptions can be made due to hardship cases, and that is the fees allowed to the lawyers. And secondly, the Swiss authorities have stayed the execution of the confiscation decisions, whereas paragraph 23 of the Security Council Resolution talks explicitly about immediately transferring the funds to the development fund for Iraq. So on what basis has the Swiss government considered, because the argument was made that it has no room for maneuver, on what basis does the government consider that it can make these exceptions? And what is the extent of the possible exceptions that the government considers it can make in accordance with its so-called mandatory obligations under the resolution? Thank you.",
        "538": "Thank you, President. Well, in the resolution 1483, it's clearly defined who should be targeted by those sanctions. We have letter A, funds or other financial assets or economic resources of the previous government of Iraq or its state bodies, et cetera. And then we have letter B, funds or other financial assets or economic resources that have been removed from Iraq or acquired by Saddam Hussein or other senior officials, et cetera. So what now the question to the applicant, what is your argumentation? Is it, do you argue that the applicants do not fall under neither of those provisions? And if that's your argument, why does he not fall under those provisions? Do you think it was arbitrary to include him because there was a misunderstanding, he was taken for somebody else? Or do you argue that this text was interpreted in a wrong way when he was listed? Or do you argue it was disproportionate? Or do you argue, yes, in substance, it was correct if the text of the resolution is accepted as it is, but there was no fair trial? Or do you argue that the personal scope of the resolution should have been defined differently? Or do you argue the resolution should not have been adopted as it has been adopted? Thank you.",
        "539": "Thank you. Mr. President, my question is in line with the previous questions of judges Nu\u00dfberger and Sicilianos. I appreciate the parties' submissions regarding conflicts between various norms of international law, but I propose to look more intensely to the applicant. And if you return to the first applicant, he was punished just because of being a senior official of the state without justifying the personal responsibility. My question is, is it evident for the parties? And what did the applicant seek the justice in this respect when he applied to the Swiss authorities? And as I understand, please correct me if I'm wrong, the sanctions committee refused to withdraw the applicant from the list of respective persons just because confirming that he was an official, senior official in the state, that in conformity with the direct rule of the resolution. Thank you.",
        "540": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma premi\u00e8re question est adress\u00e9e au requ\u00e9rant. Donc, dans le proc\u00e8s verbal qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9 par l'inspecteur Clays \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Bouyid Mohamed, M. Bouyid Mohamed mentionne le fait qu'il est plus vuln\u00e9rable \u00e0 cause de l'origine marocaine. Par la suite, dans votre plante et dans tous les documents qui vous avez d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, vous faites plus r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette condition d'\u00eatre fait partir d'une minorit\u00e9 visible, dont M. Bouyid fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son premier proc\u00e8s verbal. Donc, je voulais savoir o\u00f9 vous \u00eates par rapport \u00e0 cette question et quelle est votre position. Les autres deux questions s'adressent au gouvernement belge, \u00e0 l'Agence de gouvernement belge, et je voulais vous demander du point de vue d'abord proc\u00e9dural par rapport au comit\u00e9 P. Vous \u00eates bien s\u00fbr... Vous \u00eates au courant du fait qu'il y avait des critiques par rapport \u00e0 l'ind\u00e9pendance du comit\u00e9 P en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9es par le comit\u00e9 contre la torture du territoire humain et des grades dans les Nations unies en 2014. Donc, les critiques visent l'ind\u00e9pendance de ce comit\u00e9, mais aussi par l'existence des anciens policiers dans la composition du comit\u00e9, mais aussi la mani\u00e8re dont les enqu\u00eates sont trait\u00e9es par ce comit\u00e9. Il faut dire que ce comit\u00e9 contre la torture des Nations unies, c'est pas le seul comit\u00e9 critique, le comit\u00e9 B. Il y a aussi les autres comit\u00e9s des Nations unies, aussi c'est la Commission europ\u00e9enne contre le racisme et l'intol\u00e9rance. Donc, on voit toutes des critiques qui sont formul\u00e9es autant au plan international que au plan interne, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, par rapport \u00e0 cette ind\u00e9pendance de ce comit\u00e9. Je voulais vous demander comment l'Etat belge a pens\u00e9 faire des progr\u00e8s par rapport \u00e0 ces rapports qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 formul\u00e9s. S'agissant de ces cas et l'enqu\u00eate qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le comit\u00e9 de P, j'ai des questions concr\u00e8tes pour vous dire, \u00e0 la suite de l'enqu\u00eate qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le comit\u00e9 de P, pourquoi est-ce que, quand le juge d'instruction avait continu\u00e9 cette enqu\u00eate, comme vous l'avez mentionn\u00e9, pourquoi est-ce que certaines preuves n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9es? Parce qu'on sait qu'au moment o\u00f9, comme vous avez dit, au moment o\u00f9 M. Sa\u00efd Bouide avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interpell\u00e9, il \u00e9tait avec un ami. Pourquoi cet ami n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi entendu par le juge d'instruction? Pourquoi il n'y avait pas, par exemple, s'il y avait des cam\u00e9ras, l'image de cam\u00e9ra \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e et \u00e0 la sortie du commissariat de la police, si le commissariat de la police de la commune de Saint-Just avait ces cam\u00e9ras? Pourquoi est-ce que, s'il y a des doutes sur les questions m\u00e9dicales, comme on le voit, pourquoi est-ce qu'une contre-expertise m\u00e9dicale n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e? Et pourquoi est-ce qu'une confrontation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e, comme on proc\u00e8de d'habitude dans ces cas? Donc, \u00e7a, ce sont des questions proc\u00e9durales. La deuxi\u00e8me question que je voulais mettre concerne ce que vous dites sur la pr\u00e9somption de la causalit\u00e9 et le fait qu'il y a une diff\u00e9rence sur le fait. Donc, d'une partie, vous dites que vous \u00eates d'accord avec la pr\u00e9somption de causalit\u00e9 dans la justice de la Cour, mais d'une autre partie, vous dites que, dans ce cas, m\u00eame si les 2 requ\u00e9rants ont des certificats m\u00e9dicaux qui sont donn\u00e9s par des m\u00e9decins qui sont autoris\u00e9s en Belgique, des m\u00e9decins qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralistes, qui attestent une certaine fa\u00e7on de l'\u00e9tat des requ\u00e9rants, donc, il n'y a pas, vous dites, il n'y a pas d'effet qui sont, \u00e0 notre avis, croyables. Et je vois une certaine contradiction entre ces 2 faits. Parce que si le certificat n'est pas accept\u00e9, quelle autre preuve ils auraient pu mettre pour que \u00e7a puisse \u00eatre abord\u00e9? Comment vous voyez qu'on peut r\u00e9concilier cette acceptation de la pr\u00e9somption de causalit\u00e9 et le fait que, finalement, ces certificats donn\u00e9s par des m\u00e9decins autoris\u00e9s ne sont pas pris en consid\u00e9ration? Je vous remercie, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "541": "Thank you, Mr. President. The questions will be in English, in case you want to put the earphones. I have two factual questions, and in an aspect, they also go back to Judge Motoc's question. I would like to establish a timeline. So what happens on 8 December and 23 February, we are in the police station, then certain facts happen. At what moment in time did the applicants go to the doctor? I mean, how, if you could restore that moment. So you, they left the police station and went straight to the doctor. So that would be useful if you could provide that piece of information. That's as far as the applicants are concerned. And as far as the government is concerned, indeed, if you could explain the medical certificates. Why you do not accept, or how do you explain them? We have medical certificates, and then they are not made credible for the purposes of the subsequent investigation. That would be much appreciated. Thank you.",
        "542": "Thank you, Mr. President. In fact, I have a rather technical question. We have been explained now that there are essentially two relevant laws regulating, within different prison regimes, the question of visits. So we have been said that, of course, it's the code of procedure for the execution of sentences, but the applicants also refer and explain internal rules of correctional establishments. And my question is, in fact, to both parties. What is the legal character of these internal regulations? Are they law in a sense that the case law of the court has defined? Have they been published in the official gazette? Are they accessible? And also, I understand that on the basis of these internal regulations, a number of important arrangements in relation to visits take place or carried out. Are these arrangements, if the persons concerned are not satisfied, can they be appealed, these decisions taken within the correctional establishment? So any information concerning the nature, essentially, of these internal rules would be helpful. Thank you.",
        "543": "Thank you very much, President. I have two questions to each party. One question, I will start with the question to the government first. The applicant's representative suggested that during all short-term visits he received from his family members, the meeting room was separated by class participation and the guard was listening at hearing distance. Was that really so? And were such modalities related to the applicant's personality and individual situations, or were they generally applied to all prisoners? And to the applicant's representative, I would like to get the information, how is now the situation with respect to family visits of the applicant? Does he receive any visits from his family members? And if so, which, what frequency? Thank you.",
        "544": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais aussi poser une question aux repr\u00e9sentants du gouvernement, M. Matyushkin. La repr\u00e9sentante du requ\u00e9rant nous a dit que les ann\u00e9es pass\u00e9es en d\u00e9tention provisoire ne sont pas prises en compte, ne sont pas compt\u00e9es pour l'application du d\u00e9lai de 10 ans pendant lequel il existe une prohibition de visite longue. Par cons\u00e9quent, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, nous dit la partie requ\u00e9rante, l'interdiction en question est bien plus longue que 10 ans et qu'en l'occurrence, elle a dur\u00e9 15 ans. Donc je voudrais savoir si vous confirmez ou non ces affirmations de la partie requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 la fois en droit et factuellement.",
        "545": "Thank you, President. My question goes to both parties. I understand from the government's presentation that the purpose which the restriction is supposed to serve is the reforming of convicts sentenced to life imprisonment. To what extent, and this is related to the question of Judge Steiner, to what extent is this level of reforming measured or assessed throughout the 10 years in which the restriction is automatically imposed by the law? And on the other side, when considering requests for early release, do your courts take into consideration the extent of reforming? And does this extent form a part of the criteria for such assessment? Thank you.",
        "546": "Thank you. The government has argued on the issue of admissibility that the applicant has been divorced in 1996. And I first wanted to ask the applicant to comment on this issue. And second, I wanted to ask the government how this rule on conjugal visits generally is interpreted. Is it only applied to really married partners or also to partners living together in some other form? Is it really dependent on the fact of being married? Because I understand in the material of the case that the applicant kept in contact with his ex-wife. Thank you.",
        "547": "Thank you, Mr. President. And I have two questions to both parties. And first to the government. The government, in the observations and also today, refers to the separate area reserved by the police for the media, which was on the square opposite to Kiasma Museum on the other side of the street. However, it can be seen from the photos and from the video film that when the situation turned violent, visibility from that area to the scene was blocked by the police cordon, police cabs, and buses. And my question is, was this area really useful for the journalists to cover the event on the spot when it turned violent? My second question to the government concerns the apprehension time of the applicant and the legal basis of that. And the applicant was apprehended for 17.5 hours. And my question concerns the justification for the last 5.5 hours. Since according to the Police Act, a person could not be kept apprehended for more than 12 hours, and the longer apprehension time, up to 24 hours by the Criminal Investigation Act, would have been applicable only if arrest was available. And the applicant was charged and convicted of disobeying police order, and the statutory sanction of that would not have allowed arrest. Now, I understood from the submission of the government that the government's allegation is that the applicant was apprehended of rioting, and it was only later changed to disobeying police orders. However, according to the Ombudsman, a bystander who did not take part in violent actions as the applicant could not be apprehended of rioting. And therefore, the longer apprehension time, this 24 hours, seems to be excluded. And my question now is, since the legal basis for the apprehension for 12 hours, it's clear, but the question concerns the legal basis for the rest 5.5 hours. And then I have two questions to the applicant. And the applicant stated in his observation, and also today, that the police at the scene tried to hamper his journalistic work. However, in the video films, and in photos, and in witness hearings before the National Court, there did not appear any indication of hindering by the police carrying out his work as a photographer. And further, the applicant did not raise these allegations before the National Court or before the chamber. And now, after eight years behind the incidents, after the incidents, he raises new facts. And I only would like to mention the fact he raised today, here before the grand chamber, for the very first time, the allegation that he wished to give the memory card to the other journalist, which was not permitted by the police. So my question is, why the applicant did not raise these facts and these allegations before the National Court or before the chamber? Why the grand chamber is the first stage when these facts come out? My other question concerns the press card, the badge. And here, I again refer to the video film and the photo submitted by the applicant. And in any shots, in any photos taken of the applicant at the scene, the press card cannot be seen. And my question is, did he have the press card suspending around his neck? And was it visible when he was working on the spot when the order to disperse was given? Thank you.",
        "548": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai deux questions. La premi\u00e8re s'adresse au gouvernement. Si un journaliste avait la crainte que le groupe des derniers manifestants qui refusait d'ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la police risquait de subir des mesures brutales, la d\u00e9cision de ce journaliste de rester sur place \u00e9tait-elle li\u00e9e ou non \u00e0 son travail d'information? Ma seconde question s'adresse au requ\u00e9rant. Dans ce que vous avez appel\u00e9 des situations extr\u00eames, c'est-\u00e0-dire, \u00e0 mes yeux, des manifestations, des catastrophes, des prises d'otages, est-ce qu'il suffit au journaliste d'invoquer sa mission d'information pour refuser d'ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la police? Si la r\u00e9ponse, selon vous, d\u00e9pend des circonstances, quels sont alors, \u00e0 votre avis, les crit\u00e8res qui doivent guider le comportement des journalistes face \u00e0 des instructions ou des ordres de la police?",
        "549": "Thank you, Mr. President. The essence of the case, as characterized by the applicant, and my first question concerns the applicant, the essence of the case, as characterized by the applicant in the reasons for referring the case to the ground chamber, is the right of the state to restrict the impartation of real-time communications. Now, today, the applicant raised the argument that he was refused to hand over the memory card, as already stated in the question of Judge Hirvel\u00e4. My question is, was this raised before, either before the domestic authorities? I haven't seen it in the file. And second, has the newspaper tried, during the period of custody, to get hold of this material? My second question is for the government and is related to the same matter. The government observes that the purpose of arresting the applicant was not to hinder his freedom of expression, but to investigate the offense that he was suspected to have committed. And in this connection, the government recalls that the applicant was able to use all of his photographs he may have had from the event. Now, my question is, the government acknowledges that at a certain moment in time, the authorities realized that the person apprehended was a journalist. This was at 9.30 p.m. or somewhat later the day. Have the government considered the possible interest of immediate use of the photographs taken by the person apprehended?",
        "550": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma 1re question s'adresse au gouvernement. Et vous avez dit qu'il y avait des informations concernant lesquelles cette manifestation pouvait tourner dans une manifestation tr\u00e8s violente et que c'\u00e9tait l'Agence de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 finlandaise qui avait donn\u00e9 cette information. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est possible, je voulais savoir dans quelle mesure les informations qui \u00e9taient donn\u00e9es par cette agence ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en consid\u00e9ration par le d\u00e9ploiement de la police et par la suite, par la manifestation elle-m\u00eame. Si vraiment l'information qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 correspondue \u00e0 l'ampleur de la manifestation et aux actions violentes qui \u00e9taient sur place. La 2e question que je voulais poser s'adresse au r\u00e9current cette fois-ci. Et je voulais savoir si vraiment... Comment est-ce que vous percevez dans la jurisprudence de la Cour l'effet dissuasif que nos coll\u00e8gues qui font l'opinion s\u00e9par\u00e9e, et vous-m\u00eame maintenant devant la Grande Chambre, ont fait, ont expos\u00e9 dans leur opinion s\u00e9par\u00e9e? Est-ce que, comme vous le savez, cet effet dissuasif part de jugements de la Grande Chambre, comprenant Mazar\u00e9, et continue avec des autres jugements de la Cour, mais ces jugements-l\u00e0 vont toujours envers la condamnation p\u00e9nale? Et une 3e question que je vais mettre en deux parties, si, \u00e0 part les investigations qui \u00e9taient faites par l'Ombudsman, il y avait d'autres investigations qui \u00e9taient faites par rapport au comportement de la police, et si vraiment on a trouv\u00e9 qu'il y avait des plaintes contre le comportement de la police par des manifestants, et si vraiment, si ces plaintes avaient eu lieu, comment est-ce que la fin de cette plainte s'est pass\u00e9e? Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "551": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions that are somehow peripheral. They both concern the exact scope of the case. I think that it is important to know exactly what we are speaking about. My first question goes to the applicant. In your application, you are invoking only Article 10 of the convention. You do not invoke Article 11 on the freedom of assembly. However, in contesting that the impugned interference was prescribed by law, your observations to the Grand Chamber mentioned the following, and a small quotation from paragraph 86 of your observations. You say, the police's decision to treat the demonstration as a riot following its order for the public to disperse was questionable. And then the extent of aggressive behavior was relatively small, and so on. So apparently, you contest the legal basis of the police decision to disperse the demonstration. So my question is whether you could clarify your position in respect of the scope of this case. The second question goes to the government. The agent, Mr. Kosonen, and you have repeatedly mentioned the term of rioting. Could you please clarify the meaning and scope of this term under national law and practice? Thank you very much.",
        "552": "Thank you, Mr. President. A quick question to the government for clarification of factual assertions made by the government here today as regards the real-time assessment of the need for apprehension. The applicant mentions at paragraph 133 of their observations the testimony given by the apprehending police officer, Mr. Tero Kivikangas, where he says, Mr. Pentik\u00e4inen asked why he was being arrested, to which I replied that this was not an arrest but an apprehension. So my question is, is the government contention or submitting now that when the police apprehended the applicant, which I assume was based on the measure according to the Police Act, the police was not reacting to the disobedience of an order, but the police was apprehending the applicant to remove a disturbance according to the Police Act. So the fact that the assessment of the necessity of the interference being a disobedience of an order, that is not made by the police but by prosecutorial discretion or authorities at a later stage. Could I get a clarification on that issue as in my view it can have a bearing on proportionality? Thank you.",
        "553": "Thank you. I have one question to the applicant, a factual question. You mentioned, the lawyers mentioned, and it's in the file, that there was a call from the applicant to his employer or the editor of the magazine. Could you please retell in as great detail as possible if you wish, the contents of that conversation? Who asked what? Who said what? And whose was the final word? Thank you.",
        "554": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to first to the applicant. You said about social issues, freedom of expression, ideas of political importance, and the right to impart and receive information. Could you please specify what kind of social issues you try to impart and then to information on some social issues important to the public during this demonstration? And the question to the government, were there any position on such public issues of public debate was manifested by the demonstration? So in fact, what it was, a demonstration or a crowd? Thank you.",
        "555": "Thank you, Mr. President. My questions, it's one big question with several sub-points, goes principally to the applicants' representatives, but of course the government is also welcome to comment on that. Since the applicant made just now in the submissions a very interesting submissions on the principles as concerns, the application of freedom of expression in relation to internet media. I would like you to clarify exactly what your sort of view is. Am I right in understanding that the applicant's position is that in the name of freedom of expression, there is no obligation of pre-monitoring? Or you can probably subdivide it either by internet media or, and that's where I didn't quite understand your position, or your position is that it only, this lack of obligation applies to intermediary. So if you would clarify that. And from here, I simply note that as you submitted yourselves already at the time of the facts, some filtering system was put in place by Delphi, and you also pointed out that in fact, there is also a possibility that a particular journalist monitors the comments as attached to the article and then can propose that inappropriate comment is deleted. So of course, while understanding that the filtering system with these few additions is not what pre-monitoring means in the expert world in this area, may I ask you to clarify, say, what were the considerations or the principles? And what were the purposes then for Delphi to put in place the filtering system and also these two other sort of, I understand, random possibilities of monitoring the comments? So it is all linked to my question as to how you understand the scope or the type of obligations of the internet media. And linked to that is, you were mentioning that the filtering system was capable of catching inappropriate words. Could you maybe elaborate what were the inappropriate words that this filtering system was capturing? And since the comments that are at the centre of the case, we have them in paragraph 14, I believe, of the Chamber Judgment. We have all seen those comments. So my question linked to those words is, am I right in assuming that those words are considered appropriate by the filtering system as in place at the time? Thank you.",
        "556": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have some factual issues that I would like to explore with the applicant and then one question to the government. It seems clear from the facts as established by the chamber that the defamed person, the head of this shipping company at national level, he brought a claim to the applicant company, Philadelphia, six weeks after the article in question had been published. My question is, as I understand it from the chamber judgment and now your submissions, did he only submit a claim for damages? Did he request that the comments be removed or was that a request that he did not make? Now as regards this request removal, had the defamed person been in any contact, direct or indirectly, with the applicant company before these six weeks, that is before he formally submitted the claim for damages? My second factual issue to the applicants is your submission here today, which I find intriguing, where you discuss what you call the willful blindness institution, where you state, if I recall correctly, that is a situation where the applicant deems he has a higher level of care. Could you explain to me what kind of situations you're dealing with? Is that limited to articles which prior to publication would be considered provocative? And moving from there, would you accept in this case that if the article in question would not have been a balanced one and in accordance with journalistic ethics, as you mentioned, that liability of the sort that the applicant company was imposed would have been a proportionate measure under Article 10? The last issue regarding the facts is the issue of the possibility of the defamed person to establish the identity of the authors. The government said, and I hope I wrote it down correctly, nothing prevented Delphi to involve the commentators as third parties to the proceedings. Can I especially ask you to respond to that assertion by the government? And may I ask, did the injured person request disclosure of the commentators in question, the IP addresses as they were, as I understand it, all anonymous? Lastly, my question to the government. The government, the applicant alleges in this case that the interference at national level was not prescribed by law. The chamber in this case acknowledges that the legislation in question was, and I quote, general and lacked detail. The government says here today, and I quote, everybody who makes information available to third persons is considered to be a discloser. May I ask for clarification on the following issue? Before the decisions at national level in Delphi, had this rule of civil liability ever been applied by the domestic courts to a situation where the alleged discloser had no prior control, editorial or otherwise, to the content of the information made available to third parties? And in relation to that, to what extent are we to consider the application of this rule in Delphi's case to be one of strict, no culpa, objective tort liability? Or is it based on a showing of actual knowledge of the illegal content of the information in question? And would this rule, under the way in which you describe it, would that automatically apply to social media platforms like Facebook or YouTube? Because these intermediaries, these social platforms, indeed make available information to third parties. So my question is, would this rule apply with the same kind of force to these social media platforms? Thank you.",
        "557": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. My question is addressed principally to the government, but of course the applicant company might wish to comment as well. The international documents adopted in this field, including those of the Council of Europe, which have been referred to extensively in the Chamber of Judgment and in memorials, show, at least in my view, a clear trend towards the opportunity of differentiating the regime of the Internet, especially as far as Article 10 of the Convention issues are concerned, from the regulation of, so to speak, traditional media. And we know, of course, that the position of the government is in the sense that the traditional legal framework, basically the civil code, so the \"neminem laedere\" principle, is sufficient to satisfy the needs of Article 10. Now, my question is, is there any reflection going on at the parliament level, at the government level or in other political circles, about the possible introduction of a specific legislation in Estonia on the model of, for instance, what has been done in the United Kingdom with the approval last year of the Deformation Act 2013 applicable for England and Wales? Thank you very much.",
        "558": "Thank you, President. I have a factual question to the applicant company. And in fact, it follows the question put by Judge Ziemele. We know that since the chamber judgment, the applicant company changed its business model as regards comments. And it now pre-moderates all incoming comments. It controls whether the comments comply with the rules on commenting. My question is, how many moderators does Delphi employ to pre-moderate these comments? Thank you.",
        "559": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the applicant. In the chamber judgment in paragraph 10, is quoted a kind of disclaimer by your company, and I'm quoting that paragraph saying, the applicant company had made efforts to advise users that the comments were not its opinion and that the authors of comments were responsible for their content in the conditions where the users are anonymous. How can this disclaimer be operational, and have you referred to this during the domestic proceedings? Thank you.",
        "560": "The question is mainly addressed to the respondent government. Could you please explain the court the current situation concerning the proceedings in the case file 20-849, especially in respect of following the decision of 12th of September from 2005 to quash the previous decision of 3rd of December 2004. And in this respect also explain how the applicants have and their representatives have been granted or afforded access to the materials of the investigation file in this case.",
        "561": "Thank you, Madam President. I have two questions. The first one concerns the investigation. According to the statement by the Ossetian EMERCOM Minister Sikoyev, at 7 a.m. on 4 September, the EMERCOM team started the clearance operation. They worked in parallel with the staff of the FSB, Army SAPES, and the Prosecutor's Office. They collected the remains of 323 hostages. 31 terrorist bodies were also found. During the day, the EMERCOM staff cleared the debris with the use of cranes, bulldozers, and excavators. EMERCOM had finished the clearance work at 7 p.m. \u2013 that is in 12 hours, more or less \u2013 after which the building was rendered to the local administration. So my question is, what was the impact of this clearance operation on the possibility to investigate on exactly what happened the previous days, and especially during the rescue operation? The applicants briefly referred to this issue, so my question goes mainly to the government. My second question is purely legal, and it goes to both parties. It concerns the planning and control of the rescue operation. If I got it right, Mr. Matyushkin, you said, and I quote, the use of force was a forced measure when the situation became critical. In other words, you seem to implicitly refer to the international law concept of the state of necessity as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness codified by the UN International Law Commission in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility. My question is whether this concept of state of necessity is legally relevant in our case. Thank you very much.",
        "562": "Thank you, Madam President. I have two questions to the government and one question to the applicants. Apart from victim status, as we heard from Mr. Matyushkin, do the government support the previous observation on admissibility and whether they want to clarify something on this issue? Second question is about the criminal case against the terrorist. What does it give the understanding, a full understanding, what kind of understanding of circumstances of this case? And the question to the applicants, did the terrorist use indiscriminate weapons except bombs during this operation? And do the government support the previous observation?",
        "563": "Thank you, Mr. President. It's a question to both parties. According to submissions by the parties, Order No. 70 on technical requirements for the system of technical facilities enabling the conduct of operational search activities using telecommunications network, issued by the Ministry of Communications on 20 April 1999, stipulates that equipment installed by communications service providers must meet certain technical requirements which are described in the addendums to the order. Those addendums have never been officially published. I would like to know more about the functioning of this order in practice and its impact on the various safeguards and guarantees provided by the applicable legislation, especially the authorization procedure. Thank you very much.",
        "564": "Thank you, Mr. President. In view of the applicant's submissions, and since the second part of the submissions addressed the question of notification in greater detail, I would like to ask the government to explain exactly this aspect in your sort of rebuttals. Because would the government really confirm that there is no obligation to notify of surveillance that had taken place and that had not led to any criminal proceedings? So would the government confirm that that is indeed the case? And the applicant just referred to your written submissions. And if that is so, could the government explain the reasons for such approach in the Russian legislation? And is the government of the view that you basically don't have to provide this opportunity to your citizens to have the information that the Surveillance Act had taken place? In that context, how would you explain that in the applicant's case, the domestic courts, in fact, did not accept his submissions saying that he has failed to discharge the burden of proof? He has failed to demonstrate the facts that might lead to consideration that he has been submitted to surveillance. How would he be able to meet that burden of proof in domestic proceedings if there is no way for him to find out what is happening, that there is no this notification obligation? So if you would really address specifically this part outside the criminal proceedings. Thank you.",
        "565": "Thank you, Mr. President. It's a bit following up on the previous question also about the notification of the interception to the subject. Both parties have referred to the fact that according to Russian law, the major part, and now I'm quoting from the government's memorial, the major part of operational search activities requested by the relevant authorities from the court is secret in nature. And that may be partly an explanation or an answer to Judge Seymour's question, but I would like to know more about the notion of a state secret under Russian law. What is a state secret? Who decides that something is a state secret? And is it possible to challenge that qualification? Thank you.",
        "566": "A question for the applicants, we have heard today that the government is raising the issue of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. And you did not refer to that. We didn't hear about that before. It is for the first time that the government is raising that issue. So I think it would be valuable for all of us that you address that. Thank you.",
        "567": "Thank you. My question is mostly to the representatives of the Azerbaijani government. It seems to be from the statement that it's relevant in this case, the context, the geographical context, taking into account that Gulistan or the property of the applicants seems to be in or near the euphemistically called line of contact, maybe should be called front line. Well, apart from all the general disasters deriving from a conflict such as the existence of refugees or dispel or spell persons, seems to me that there are specific damages for property, personal or real property, deriving from this situation in the front line or line of contact. Specific damages different from general expulsion of persons or displaced persons. Now my question is, is there in Azerbaijan some specific normative or regulation concerning this particular and specific damages resulted from direct military action or violent action in the line of contact or the front line? I mean, is there any specific provision in the legal order in this aspect?",
        "568": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is addressed to the applicant. The applicant did not address the main argument of the respondent government regarding jurisdiction. The respondent government say that they prohibited access of civilians to this particular area because it is dangerous. And they gave an order which is secret with that purpose of avoiding civilians in that particularly dangerous area. It would be, in their view, unreasonable to request the respondent state to permit access to and circulation of civilians on the line of contact, on the ceasefire line. I would like to hear the position of the applicant on this specific argument, having in account Article 57 of the 1977 Geneva Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, which relate to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. And there, you find that there is a legal obligation, an international obligation of states regarding victims of international armed conflicts. And specifically, states have the duty to provide for all reasonable precautions to avoid any losses of civilian lives. My question is, the legitimacy of this order of the respondent government is, yes or no, grounded on international humanitarian law and the law of war. Thank you.",
        "569": "Thank you, President. I have two questions to the respondent government. My first question is somehow continues the question which Judge Albuquerque has already put. My question is, you stated that it is for the security reasons that applicants didn't allow to return back. I know very well the area. There are many other villages which are with the same distance from the contact line, which are on the border, but populated by Azeris. How is it that you can guarantee the safety of one group of people and not the others? This is my first question. And my second question concerns your oral submissions about the Armenian government's refusal for the return of refugees. You have stated that Azerbaijan voted for the return of refugees in the General Assembly of the United Nations. What was the resolution which you have mentioned? Did you mean the resolution against which voted also all member states of the Security Council and the states which are in the Minsk Group? If it is so, was it the only point in that resolution? And Mr. President, I have also one factual question concerning the Azerbaijani government's statements about the 20% of their territories which are under the control of the Armenian forces. I would like to have more precise figures. What is the territory of Azerbaijan? And what is the territory which you mean that under the control of the Armenian forces? I went to different sources and I found that the territory of Azerbaijan for the moment is 86,600 square kilometers. And the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is 4,388 at the time when it was in the Soviet Union. And now it is 11,458. I would like to know whether 11,458 square meters is 20% of 86,000 square kilometers. This will be my question and I hope I will get answer to my questions unlike in the previous hearing when I didn't get any answer to my questions. Thank you.",
        "570": "Thank you, President. I have a question to put to the representatives of the government. And of course, the applicant is free to comment by way of reply. I appreciate the distinction that was drawn between the resolution number 96 adopted by the United Nations in 1946 and the subsequent UN Convention on Genocide two years later. The former being declaratory, as you say, and the latter imposing major legal obligations upon states. I also appreciate the number of incidents or the number of instruments that you cited in terms of what had already transpired by the time this applicant had committed the acts in question. But what I would like your observations on, I'd like you to address the court on the applicability, if at all, of international case law on the meaning of the phrase within Article 2 of the 48 Convention, in whole or in part. We see from the court of appeal's judgment that it regarded the partisans as part of a protected group, namely the nation. And I would like to if you could address the court on the international case law and its applicability, if any, to the facts of this case in terms of the phrase in whole or in part. Thank you.",
        "571": "Thank you, Mr. President. Indeed, a question to the government, but the applicant also is welcome to express his position. It is a follow-up to Judge Power-Forde's question, and it concerns the fact that we have two victims in the case. And the question is, indeed, from the case file, it doesn't clearly transpire in what manner the domestic courts, if at all, address the quantitative aspect of the circumstances. Or am I right in understanding the government's submissions that there was, in the legal reasoning, a switch to the qualitative aspect, meaning the belonging to the protected group? So what difference did it make that there were attacks on two, allegedly on two partisans? And if you would maybe present, from the reasoning of the domestic courts, how this was addressed. Thank you.",
        "572": "Thank you, Mr. President. A question addressed to Professor Schabas, and of course, the applicant can also reply to this. You have presented to us evidence that in 1953, there was already a principle of criminalization, of persecution and extermination of political groups. And that evidence cited by you was the declaration of the United Nations General Assembly in 1946 and the position of the Soviet Union in that same General Assembly in 1946 and 1948. My question is, having in account that political genocide is not included in the Genocide Convention, the ICTR statute, the ICTY statute, the Rome Treaty of the International Criminal Court, the statute of the Special Panel for East Timor, and the extraordinary chambers in Cambodia, having in account all this history of criminal international law, can we still say, can we still argue that there is a customary norm of criminalization of political genocide? My second question addresses the ethnic genocide, the other perspective under which the case can be dealt with. In fact, it is the position of the respondent government and the domestic courts. The Court of Appeal has stated clearly in its judgment that the facts can be understood as a form of ethnic genocide. The Supreme Court accepted that point of view. And recently, the Constitutional Court confirmed that point of view. My question is the following. Can you, Professor Schabas, envisage the killing of these two brothers as a part of this selective ethnic genocide insofar that it targeted groups of people, partisans, farmers, small property owners, intellectual elite, priests, public officials, which were selected for the impact that their disappearance would have upon the survival of the lithuanian  nation as such? So my question does not address the development of case law as Judge Power's question. Mine is a little bit different, is on your views about the assessment of this case under ethnic genocide, under the perspective of an ethnic genocide. Thank you very much.",
        "573": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question concerns basically specific intent. The International Court of Justice, among others, in the Bosnia-Herzegovina versus Serbia-Montenegro case refers to the requirement of specific intent. My first question is whether the government is of the view that this is a constitutive element of the crime of genocide. Secondly, in the domestic judgment, there is an expression which is translated as direct intent. Allow me to quote the original \"tiesiogin\u0117 ty\u010dia\". I wonder whether this is the same as specific intent, and if not, what is the relation between the two? I ask this with a specific background assumption in mind, or actually I don't have an assumption, but I would like a specific clarification. The applicant claimed that on the one hand, the action, the impound action, cannot be genocide because this was an action against members of a partisan army, and there can be no genocide of a partisan army. This is a question that requires answer. And secondly, if this was the intention of the MGB operation or the Soviet occupying forces, then how is this satisfying the requirement of specific intent required in the context of genocide? Moreover, is specific genocide a matter of personal knowledge, or is this a specific intent of the group of which the applicant was part of? The applicant claims that the MGB actions were directed against fascists and nationalists, and I think it's fair to say that it was also part of what the Soviet authorities called a class war. So I wonder whether the activities of the MGB were referring to specific intent to carry out action to satisfy these goals, or these goals fall under specific intent required by a certain interpretation of the Genocide Convention. A very technical question, completely unrelated, just to be on the safe side, the Constitutional Court judgment gives reference to a number of applications. I assume that none of these applications, or none of the applicants to the Constitutional Court is the applicant present here. Thank you.",
        "574": "My question is directed to Professor Schabas. If I have understood correctly, your presentation, your claim, basically was that for the applicant, it was sufficient for the foreseeability to realize that at the time when he was acting, this was some type of international crime. It was not important that was in particular a genocide. Do you think that this would be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of Article 7 if we are taking into consideration that not only fair notice is important, but also the limitation of the discretion of the government? And this is also in continuation to the question posed by our president to what extent war crimes and crimes against humanity are actually applicable in this case, since two applicants were not civilians, or at least I understood that they are not civilians from the presentation today. And at the time when they were killed, there was no war in Lithuania. Thank you.",
        "575": "Yes, thank you, Mr. President. I have one question concerning to Professor Schabas, concerning the definition, or better to say, a notion of political group as a possible object of the protection under the Genocide Convention. Actually, do we have more closer criteria or elements to define, to determine what is the political group as an object of protection on the Genocide Convention, specifically in the context of the recent case law of international courts and tribunals concerning application of Genocide Convention? Thank you, Mr. President.",
        "576": "Thank you, Mr. President. I will have a number of questions to the respondent government. And that has to do with the fact that the court has not been provided with the memorandum of understanding. Now, I would appreciate if you explained a number of points that evidently are related to this memorandum of understanding. In your submissions just now, you mentioned that your forces on the ground operated strictly outside the chain of command. That's the phrase that you used. Now, could you exemplify that with some language from the relevant memorandum of understanding? What does it mean exactly? And would you follow up question to that? I understand that there were several memorandums of understanding, depending on which state was a lead nation in the area, and then the participant nations. And so these were the participants to the memorandum of understanding. Now, in the court's possession, there is one sample of such a memorandum of understanding. And I would like to know whether you would accept that, basically, these memorandums of understanding were more or less a typical sort of for, I wouldn't go as far as to say stereotype, did not contain stereotype language, but they were quite similar. That's my first question. Were they? And secondly, would you accept that in your respective memorandum of understanding, which, as I said, we don't have, the memorandum contained something like that as concerns national contingents? The principle was, and was it in your case as well, that members of national contingents will remain under full command of their participant through their national contingent commander. Is that the same principle as applied in your case? And would you explain to the court, what does it mean, full command, as far as the contingent commander was concerned, and the operational control attributed to the United Kingdom? And my other question concerns the, it's a more technical, I should say. It concerns the episode about the autopsy that was explained by the parties here. We do know from the facts that no Iraqi, no Netherlands official was present at the autopsy. Could you explain why? And do you have any record to that effect? Sort of giving evidence why this participation at the autopsy was not possible. And do you have anything like that in your possession? I think that is all, Mr. President. Thank you.",
        "577": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai deux petites questions sur les faits. Peut-\u00eatre sont-elles de d\u00e9tail. Peut-\u00eatre la r\u00e9ponse se trouve d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans le dossier. Si c'est le cas, je m'en excuse. Je me r\u00e9f\u00e8re au paragraphe 10 et 11 du document avant-projet de r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure et des faits qui est pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le greffe, que les partis vous connaissez, dans les paragraphes 10 et 11. Donc, il est dit que la nuit du 21 avril 2004, vers 2h12, une voiture inconnue traversa un poste de contr\u00f4le appel\u00e9 B-13. C'est le premier incident qui s'est produit. Et il y a eu un \u00e9changement de tirs. Il est dit que de l'int\u00e9rieur de la voiture, des coups de feu furent tir\u00e9s vers des personnes qui gardaient le checkpoint, toutes membres du corps irakien de d\u00e9fense civile. Ma premi\u00e8re question est, et je m'adresse aux deux partis, qui \u00e9tait en charge du poste de contr\u00f4le appel\u00e9 B-13, la nuit du 21 avril 2004? Et ensuite, au paragraphe 11, il est dit que le sergent HS, commandant du poste de contr\u00f4le, a appel\u00e9 aux militaires n\u00e9erlandais, qui sont venus en nombre de 6, men\u00e9s par le lieutenant A, et qui sont arriv\u00e9s sur place vers 2h30, c'est-\u00e0-dire une vingtaine de minutes apr\u00e8s le premier incident. Ma deuxi\u00e8me question est, o\u00f9 se trouvaient-ils les militaires n\u00e9erlandais quand ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s? Est-ce qu'ils \u00e9taient \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, une vingtaine de minutes pour arriver, loin, \u00e0 une certaine distance, dans un poste de commandement? Voil\u00e0 mes deux petites questions.",
        "578": "Merci beaucoup, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai deux questions qui sont pos\u00e9es au gouvernement de la Grande-Bretagne. Et ma premi\u00e8re question est li\u00e9e au fait que l'argument de la Grande-Bretagne est li\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me de la juridiction. Et ils disent que par rapport au cas de Al-Skeini et les autres, il n'y a pas une juridiction qui appartient aux Pays-Bas, parce que les Pays-Bas n'\u00e9taient pas une force occupante dans l'Irak, parce que c'\u00e9tait le cas selon la r\u00e9solution 1443 de la Grande-Bretagne et des Etats-Unis. Et que vous dites aussi que les Pays-Bas n'avaient pas un contr\u00f4le effectif. Donc ma question est la suivante. Qui, en fait, selon vous, en suivant le m\u00eame jugement d'Al-Skeini, avait la juridiction sur les faits qui se sont pass\u00e9s et qui ont soumis par les applicants aujourd'hui? Ma deuxi\u00e8me question, qui est toujours adress\u00e9e au gouvernement de la Grande-Bretagne, est li\u00e9e au fait qu'\u00e0 un certain moment, dans votre m\u00e9moire \u00e9crite, vous dites que si la Cour va condamner les Pays-Bas pour ce cas, on aura plus de troupes pour avoir... pour maintenir et pour mettre en place les r\u00e9solutions des Nations unies dans des cas o\u00f9 il faut appliquer le chapitre VII. Et que \u00e7a sera dissuadant pour les troupes europ\u00e9ennes ou pour les troupes en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral internationales pour venir en aide du Conseil de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans ces cas. Ma question est la suivante. Comment est-ce que vous traduisez dans des termes l\u00e9gals cette affirmation? Je vous remercie.",
        "579": "Thank you, President. I have a question, a third question to add to the two put by Judge Casadevall as regards to facts, and in particular the goings-on at the checkpoint that night, B13. In the facts which have been prepared by the court's registry, it is written that on the road leading to the checkpoint, there were several barrels set out in the middle of the road. This implies that cars, motorists arriving should stop, but from the applicants' representatives, we have heard that this was not the case. There were no barrels on the road. The barrels were on the side, thus implying that there would have been free, cars were free to drive on. There is a contradiction here, I understand, and I would like to ask the parties how this can be resolved. Thank you very much.",
        "580": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a short question to the responding government, which is only I would like to have their comment on whether it is possible to outsource jurisdiction from an occupying power, assuming that such an occupying power would have jurisdiction under the convention. And by outsourcing command and control, would it be possible to lower the threshold of jurisdiction?",
        "581": "Thank you, President. I do not consider myself an expert in extraterritorial jurisdiction. However, this is precisely the reason why I would like the Dutch government to clarify their position, whether they are actually arguing that the army of the Kingdom of Netherlands was hired by the United Kingdom government for the purposes of occupation within the sense of the UN resolution, and whether they are also submitting that the Dutch soldier in this case was in fact following the UK chain of command. Would this mean that the respondent government is actually seeing the UK government as the proper respondent for the purposes of investigation or for the purposes of the present convention proceedings? Thank you.",
        "582": "I will have two questions for the both parties. And the first question is, according to the national law, the amnesty decision, how it is understood? It is understood as a judicial decision on acquittal, as an acquittal, or as something else? This is the first question. Zna\u010di, da li ona ima karakter osloba\u0111aju\u0107e presude ili ne\u0161to drugi? Neki drugi karakter? Translate it because maybe it's easier if I translate that through translation. And then the second question is whether, according to the National Criminal Procedure Code, it was possible at all to reopen the proceedings once amnesty decision has been granted, regardless whether it was, once when the amnesty decision is granted, whether it is possible to reopen the proceedings. Thank you.",
        "583": "Thank you, Mr. President. I also have two questions for both parties. First question, does the legal qualifications of the facts in the first set of proceedings made by Osijek County Court as ordinary murder, not war crimes, amounts fundamental defects according criminal procedure law of Croatia and in the context of paragraph 2, article 4, protocol 7 of the convention? And the second question, if there was a fundamental defect in the proceeding, whether the higher courts in the following procedure were obliged to correct this defect? Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.",
        "584": "Thank you, President. My question goes also to both parties. I would like to have further clarification on the circumstances in which a request for review of legality may be lodged in the general terms of your applicable criminal procedure code.",
        "585": "Yes, I would have some questions concerning the facts. So my first question is, when did the church know about the fact that the applicant adhered or was a member of this movement for optional celibacy? Was it known already before the publication of the article or was this information only known by the publication of the article? My second question is, I understand that the applicant consented in being photographed together with his family. Did he know that this photo would be used for a report on the meeting of the movement for optional celibacy? Was he conscious of this fact? And third question, after the civil marriage of the applicant between 1984 and 1997, it's not clear to me what was his clerical status. As he got the dispensation only in 1997 with the consequence of losing the rights of obligations, I understand that in theory he still had these rights between 1984 and 1997, that is during the period when he was teaching religion at the secondary school. Thank you.",
        "586": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. The first is a question for clarification, merely. And the second is also a question of fact. And they're directed towards the government. There's quite a lot in the government's submissions in relation to the nature of the financial arrangements and the salary arrangements, and indeed the history of those arrangements within Spain. And there's reference to the 79 agreement, the 93 agreement, but the government observations state that the 1982 decision or agreement was the one that was in force and applicable at the time, and that the applicant was paid directly by the authority out of the relevant contributions. Could you clarify whether or not in any way there was a contribution, direct or indirect, from the Episcopal conference to the state, even though the state paid the salary of the applicant directly? That's the first question. The second question that I have relates to the dispute between the parties as to the cause of the decision not to renew, and whether that decision was based purely on the publicity, which may not always be under a person's control, or the voiced criticisms of the group of which the member was an applicant. And in its submissions before the chamber, and indeed again today, the government has relied upon the Spanish constitutional court's decision of the 14th of April, 2011, to show that in that case the court found that the non-renewal of that particular teacher's contract breached her rights to family privacy, because she had never made her situation public. She had never campaigned. And my question is the follow-up to that judgment. How did the respondent state deal with that judgment? Was the applicant in that case, was she re-nominated by the church despite its original first decision not to re-nominate her? Or was the contract renewed in any event by the state, regardless of the church's position, but in compliance with the constitutional court's judgment? So that's a question of fact in the context of how the state dealt with that constitutional court judgment decision. Thank you.",
        "587": "Merci, Monsieur le President. I would like to ask two questions, one relating to the situation under canon law before the applicant was not renewed, and the other question relating to the situation under purely civil law relating to the decision not to renew his position. First, about the situation under canon law, and it follows up somewhat on one of the questions that was posed by my colleague. We heard from Mr. Maz\u00f3n Costa that the applicant, once he got married, was in fact no longer a priest, that he was, under canon law, an ex-priest. Could that be confirmed? And the question is, what was his situation under canon law as long as he did not receive dispensation? And I'm also interested in knowing why the applicant was interested in obtaining a dispensation. What was the advantage of a dispensation? And finally, still with respect to the dispensation, he finally received the dispensation through a rescript of 1997. And if I understand it well, it's a decision that has been taken upon a request made in 1984, 13 years before. Can this long delay be explained? And is it a coincidence that the rescript was granted half a year after the publication of the article? My second question is about the reaction of the state purely under civil law after it received the request by the bishop not to renew the contract of the applicant. Did the state simply transmit that request or the non-renewal of the certificate or in whatever form it was made to the applicant? Or did the state at that time take any other action with respect to the applicant? To be more clear, did the state examine the request of the bishop, and was it concerned with the situation of the applicant in the educational system? Did it, for instance, look whether there was another possibility to make use of the applicant's qualifications as a teacher? Thank you for your answer.",
        "588": "Thank you. I do have a question to both parties or particularly to the government, because in this case that was not renewal of the contract and not dismissal from the post of the teacher. My question is relating to this renewal. Were there any particular reasons why the contract was concluded every time for one year only? What were the reasons if there were some or any? Was there, existed there obligation to renew the contract after one year? If yes, under which condition or if there was no obligation to renew the contract? And whether there are any statistics? I am sure that it was not the first case. I'd like to know when there was not renewal in other cases, what most usually were the reasons for not renewal. Thank you.",
        "589": "Thank you, Mr. President. My first question concerns the conditions or aptitude required in case of employment as a teacher of religion. Is this reserved to priests or is this something accessible to lay people? Are there specific professional qualifications related to this activity? Second question, I understand the government arguing that scandal is a concept of the religious organization and there was made reference in the submissions and in the presentation to bad conduct, as one of the grounds for finding a scandal. I just wonder whether and to what extent scandal is a concept foreseeable through precedence in canon law. So in other words, are there comparable positions taken in specific cases where a similar concept of scandal was applied? And if so, given the relationship, although this is disputed, relationship of the applicant to the church, was he in the position to understand those possibly existing precedents? I have a specific question to the government because I still don't understand the position regarding the statement made or not made by the applicant at the time of the taking of the picture. Is the government of the opinion that he made a specific statement or is the government of the opinion that this was not the case or was not proven? If I understand correctly, the applicant denies that he made a statement which was then quoted in La Verdad. And the question to the applicant, I understand that he was unemployed, although he received a severance payment and then he got a job. Now, could you explain to us in which regard his vocation was affected? Is he claiming that this dismissal denied him of continuing a vocation? Is he claiming that he couldn't teach at all? It's simply not made clear what is his loss resulting from the non-renewal in regard to his profession, which was again not clear. If I understand correctly, he's not claiming that he wants to exercise a priestly function, but I leave this to the applicant to clarify. Thank you very much.",
        "590": "Thank you very much. I would like to follow up on the issue of dispensation. Since the dispensation was granted after the article was published, my question is whether it is regularly put in dispensations that the person who is granted the dispensation is not allowed to be a religious teacher if he or she is, or he, actually, if he is connected to the scandal. And then, following to that, whether scandal would be the reason to dismiss any religious teacher, not just somebody who was the ex-priest but a layman who is the religious teacher. And then, whether the agreement between the state and the Vatican states that the scandal is a proper reason for dismissal or the reasons for dismissal are understood in a more narrower sense. Thank you.",
        "591": "Thank you, Mr. President. Since the question was raised by the two parties and was dealt with with the utmost care by the two parties, I would like to clarify an additional point in regard to this question of admissibility of the complaint. The position of the government is that this is a clear case of axio popularis. The applicants did not raise the issue at the domestic level at any moment. And the government have argued that the courts, the domestic courts, could extend by analogy the special favorable rule in case they had the chance to do it, in case they had the chance to appreciate, to rule on the unconstitutionality of the rule. That is said, and I have confirmed it, on page 7, paragraph 17 of the observations of the government, and it was repeated today. And that assertion, that statement, is based on the case law that is quoted and was repeated today of the court of cassation. My question, my precise question, is the following. Does this mean that the applicants, if the applicants had lodged an action based on section 105 of the introductory law to the civil code, in which they had pleaded the unconstitutionality of the law 3719, the domestic courts could have then determined that this law was and is unconstitutional in as much as it excludes same-sex couples, and subsequently, the domestic laws, the domestic courts, could then extend by analogy the law 3719 to the applicants? That is the question. Thank you.",
        "592": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question, a very simple question for the representative of the government. Could you explain us the main different points on one hand and main common points on the other hand among church marriage, civil marriage, and civil union in Greece? Thank you.",
        "593": "Thank you. I have a question to the government. The government has referred to the principle of subsidiarity and the advanced investigations carried out by the prosecutor in Poland and we can really read from the documents that there have been, for example, 62 persons who have been interrogated and 21 volumes of main files with documentary evidence that has been collected. However, the investigation of the allegations has been ongoing since 2008 and lasted already five years and 10 years since the alleged events. Since this case has been brought before this court today, I have to ask, what has come up in the investigation so far? Meaning, does the government challenge the allegations of the applicants or not? And my second question, which is linked to the first one, is the applicants have been granted victim status in the domestic investigation and does this indicate that there has appeared evidence that the applicants have been transferred via Poland or, or, and that they have been detained in Poland? Thank you.",
        "594": "Thank you, Madam President. I have a question to the government, but maybe the applicants, the counsels of the applicants may wish to comment on this question. The parties refer to a criminal investigation carried out under the Polish Code of Criminal Procedure. Has there been in Poland any other kind of investigation carried out by other public authorities? And if so, what are the results of those investigations? Thank you.",
        "595": "Thank you, Madam President. My first question to government is in connection with what was stated at the beginning of the government's submissions on rules of procedure. Am I correct, or would this court be correct in understanding that it is the government's view that procedural rules of this court should give way to national rules of procedure, particularly whenever confidentiality or secrecy is involved? In other words, is it government's contention that if a respondent government pleads confidentiality or secrecy, then the proceedings before this court stop? That is my first question. The second question refers to the plea of prematurity of the applications. I believe it was raised in respect of both applicants. The government is asking this court to consider that the applications are premature. Can the government comment at least on why the investigations in Poland, which began either in May or March, I don't remember exactly, of 2008, can the government comment at least on why the investigation was only started in 2008 and not before? Was it an ex officio investigation or was it on the complaint of an injured party or on a report by a public official? My third question is this. Can the government comment, if at all, on the statement made by counsel for one of the applicants that there is no remedy at domestic law, no remedy of judicial review to challenge the classification of documents in criminal investigations? My last question is, is the respondent government in a position to comment, if at all, on the change of prosecutors in this case? We've heard of at least the investigation having passed into the hands of three prosecutors. What was the reason, if this reason can be given, if at all, why there was this change of prosecutors?",
        "596": "Thank you, Madam President. My question also goes to the respondent government. As far as I understand your position, you do not contest the fact that various planes landed and took off from different airports on the territory of Poland, including Szymany . In this regard, having been informed of the applicants' complaints before this court, have the investigation or other authorities of your country been able to check and confirm, so as to confirm or deny, the fact that the applicants have been, for certain periods of time, on the territory of Poland? That is, do you maintain any border control system capable of checking the number of arriving and departing passengers, as well as their identity? My question does not go to the result of any such steps. My question is whether at all such steps have been taken.",
        "597": "Thank you, Madam President. My question is somehow related to the second question of Judge Hirvela and probably to the question of Judge Kalaydjieva. I will slightly expand it. Does it mean that the victim status of Mr. Al Nashiri, recognition at domestic level, means that to Mr. Al Nashiri is considered like being under the jurisdiction, not under the territory itself, but under the jurisdiction of Polish state, having in mind also the serving jurisprudence?",
        "598": "If I may, Monsieur le President, I have some questions. Firstly, for the state, that's to say the government of Ireland, can you give me another instance where the state pays the salary of anyone, leave out the word teacher for the moment, but is not liable for his or her misconduct vicariously? That's the first question. I have some others.",
        "599": "Secondly for the state, could a teacher by sexual abuse ever, absent negligence, make his employer vicariously liable? And then thirdly again for the state, just by way of clarification, I take it that the reference to the Carrigan Report and the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 is to the provision which makes any sexual action with a girl of 14 years or under unlawful and something to which she cannot consent. Those are my questions for the state, Mr. President. I have some also for the applicant.",
        "600": "Breyer. Okay. It is said that the master was immune and that the State wanted to sweep any allegation in relation to sexual abuse of a child under the carpet. If that is so, why is it on the transcript that, again, not using names, the master had a special arrangement by way of secretly looking into the other classroom to observe the other teacher with a piece of paper that he could uncover to see what was happening and also ceased any time there was a noise of a car in his abuse? In other words, how is your submission consistent with the fact that he feared being found out? I have another question also for the applicant. It's in relation to the bishop. In Ireland, we have a procedure called the O'Byrne letter. If you have potentially four defendants, for instance, someone trips on the road and you don't know whether the hole in the road was caused by the gas company, the electricity company, the municipal authority, you write an O'Byrne letter to all of them, and once you have written that letter calling on them to sort out liability amongst themselves, it is the losing defendant against whom the order for costs is made. That being so, what possible reason do you have for not suing the bishop? And then the last question to the applicant's representatives, and by the way, this is not addressed to the applicant who is the victim in this case. It is addressed to the council. What suggestion was actually made at trial through evidence as to the protection of children that could prevent abuse? And are you making the allegation that the Stay Safe program, which was implemented in 1999, and which all of us who have children who are under 14 or 15 are familiar with, may succeed in stopping this kind of abuse? Are you making the suggestion that it should have been a Stay Safe program, whereby there is reference taught to children about private areas, private actions, something which did not happen up to that time? So those are my questions, Mr. Lepresto.",
        "601": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions, one addressed to the, to counsel for the respondent government, and the other to both. The first question is, I would like to have some further reaction from the respondent government. What the government has to say in reply to the applicant's reference to the guidance note of the 6th of May, 1970. The applicant says it was totally ineffectual, in effect, no real guidance whatsoever. I would like to have the respondent government's reaction to that. I believe the counsel for the applicant made this statement, again reiterated the statement, even in his submissions. The second question is, and I ask this question because I don't know what the position is in Ireland totally, is apart from suing the bishop or the archbishop, which my colleague has just mentioned, is there the possibility of suing instead the diocese or the archdiocese as a juridical person? In other words, not the bishop in his individual capacity. I wonder if I could have some clarification on that point. Thank you very much.",
        "602": "Thank you, President. I have one question for the government and one question for the applicant. To the government, you have explained and attempted to distinguish the Zambrano principle as it arises in this case. But I would like you to comment on a submission made by the Immigrant Council of Ireland as to what effective legal protection actually requires. Effective legal protection. And you will see from their submissions that they deal with this under the heading of administrative and judicial decision-making bodies. The submission is that if national authorities suggest that the family may move elsewhere in the EU or are not actually forced to leave the territory of the EU, then the law would require and would expect that the decision-making bodies adverted to this possible solution and to have adduced evidence as to its practicality, its feasibility and its proportionality for any particular member. And I would ask the government, firstly, to comment on that submission, and secondly, to show where in the administrative and judicial decisions the practicality, feasibility and proportionality of a move or either within the territory has been made. And I would just draw attention to the fact that in the domestic decision of the court dated 8 December 2009, that's the regional court of The Hague sitting in Harlem, reference is made to EU law, but not to the possibility of moving within the territory, but rather to the fact that there's no obligation on the family, on the citizens to leave, EU citizens to leave, because the children could always stay in the Netherlands alone with their father. And if that alternative is to be submitted, is to be relied upon, then how would that not in fact result in a constructive interference with family life, with an interference in that the family would be broken up? That's the question that I would put to the government. To the applicant, the case, as I understand it, is mainly pleaded in terms of an interference or a failure to comply with the positive obligations insofar as the applicant's family life is concerned. And very little is made in terms of the claim under Article 8 to private life. Now, this court in a number of judgments has elected to examine both aspects, and I would like the applicants to comment on the private life of the applicant and to what extent identity as the mother of Dutch children forms part of the applicant's private life. So the applicant's identity as the mother of Dutch children, to what extent does that touch upon the applicant's private life? Thank you.",
        "603": "Thank you Mr. President. I'd like to make two factual questions to both the applicant and the government. It seems that the reason for the denial of the residence to the applicant was the lack of a provisional residence visa. This provisional residence visa has to be applied for in the country of origin of the applicant, that is in Suriname. So if the regular proceedings were followed, the applicant should go back to Suriname, then apply, they should apply them for this provisional residence visa in order to be able to go back to the Netherlands. Now my questions are, first, if the applicant would do that, would go back to Suriname and ask for a provisional residence visa, first, what would be the criteria followed by the government to allow or not to allow this provisional visa? Secondly, if up to the point you can answer to that, what are the perspectives of getting this permission, this provisional residence visa? And finally, how much time would it be needed for these proceedings? I mean, how much time would it take from asking the provisional residence visa and then to get the response by the government? Thank you.",
        "604": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question to the applicant and a question to the government, and it equally goes back to the facts of the case. The parties have pleaded in front of the court the principle of the best interests of the child. And to the applicant, I would like to know, in the set of proceedings that the applicant has initiated in the Netherlands with the view of obtaining the residence permit, in what manner and with what arguments did the applicant reason the best interests of the child, apart from the evident fact of the Dutch nationality of the children, what other arguments were advanced as concerns the need to protect the best interests of the child, and maybe in which of the numerous proceedings? And the question to the government in the same context. The government, in its observations, written observations and oral submissions, especially in paragraph 67 in your written memorial, you have mentioned several arguments showing that there was the best interests of the children have been taken into consideration. Again, a factual question. Are these the government's arguments in paragraph 67, or were these exactly the words, the reasoning used by the domestic courts or the administrative authorities? If so, could you point to the court, could you direct the court to these judgments, decisions where exactly in the same manner the best interests of the child have been assessed and balanced in the proceedings? Thank you.",
        "605": "Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions to clarify certain facts, if I may. They are mainly directed towards the government, but perhaps even the counsel for the applicant can refer to them. If I remember correctly, if I understood correctly, counsel for the government said that the husband's criminal record is no obstacle to him entering and settling in Suriname. In view of the fact that, as far as I can understand, the husband has lost Surinamese nationality and the criminal record referred to something which was not really trivial, could government elaborate on that? The second question is, apart from the repeated applications for residence, what exactly were the reasons or the reason why it took so long for the government to actually take action to expel applicant from Dutch territory? Thank you.",
        "606": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the representative of the applicant. On page 10 of your written submissions, you state that in the context of immigration cases, children carry no responsibility for choices made by parents. And in order to underline this position, referral is made to three cases of our court. First, the Nunez case, in which deportation and exclusion orders would effectively result in a mother guilty of immigration law breaches being separated from her young children for two years. Second, the case of Mubilanzila Mayeka and Kaniki Mitunga, which concerns detention and deportation of a five-year-old child without her family. And third, Osman versus Denmark. You mentioned this case also in your oral submissions today, in which refusal to renew residence permit of a minor who had been sent abroad against her will is the case. All of these cases concern a situation in which not finding a violation would result necessarily in accepting a breach of family life. And it would therefore need further explanation as to how this case law would support the applicant seeking a permanent residence in the Netherlands. Do you think this case law is also relevant in case the refusal to give permanent residence to your client would not necessarily lead to a separation, a rupture of the family?",
        "607": "Thank you, President. I have a question to the government, and it is related to the questions of judges and Power-Forde, and in a dissimilar. The government is, as far as I understand, submitting that, first of all, acknowledging that Article 8 rights are under considerations in the present case. They are also submitting that the Dutch government have not overstepped their margin of appreciation in examining this case, and that Article 8 issues have been thoroughly considered by the national authorities, whether you refer to the courts or the minister in deciding the applicant's case appears not to be quite clear, as their reasoning in the several accounts of applications seem to vary. But as a whole, from your submissions during the hearing today, it seems that you're saying that the consideration of Article 8 rights was already accepted as one involving a potential risk of alternative interference with Article 8 rights in both cases, whether the applicant should be separated from her family or whether it would result, a decision negative to the interests of the applicant would result in sending four Dutch citizens, including three children, to a country outside the territory where they were born and brought up. Do you see this as a matter of inevitable result as in view of the necessity to protect the public interests and the community interests? I would like the government to provide us with more information or views whether this is the manner in which they see that the potential interference with Article 8 rights has been thoroughly considered in your opinion.",
        "608": "Thank you, Mr. President. I do have one concrete question to the applicant. According to the chronology of events list we do have at our disposal in our files, it seems that the applicant, for the very first time, applied for a tourist visa to Netherlands on 19th of February 91. But her partner left to Netherlands at the end of October 91. So it was more than half a year before the partner left, and much more before they got married and had children. So my concrete question is, what was the reason for the applicant to apply for tourist visa in February 91?",
        "609": "My question is for both parties. At that time when applicant entered into Netherlands in 1997, the regulations in force did not require her to have obtained a provisional visa in Suriname before applying for a residence in the Netherlands. Why that law is not applicable in this case? Thank you.",
        "610": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have questions to the government. First of all, on the facts, I understand that Camp Bucca was U.S.-run camp. But yet, I will need clarification which state, the United Kingdom or the United States, or a combination of the two, was ultimately responsible for determining Tarek's status, the legality of his detention, and for ordering his release. My second question is again for the government, and this time on the law. In the case of person interned as a prisoner of war or as a civilian giving rise to a threat to security in the context of an international art conflict, should the requirements of Article 5 of the Convention be qualified or displaced by the provisions of third or fourth conventions? What is the meaning of displacement or qualification in this context? And to what extent, if at all, should the safeguards under Article 5, paragraph 1, 2, and 4 continue to apply? Thank you.",
        "611": "Thank you, Mr. President. As a follow-up to the questions by Judge Yudkivska, the question to the government that the applicants may want to comment as well. First, as to your thesis that the convention is displaced in the context of armed conflict, what value do you attribute to the International Courts of Justice statement of principle in the Wall advisory opinion, as repeated subsequently in a number of judgments? And what is the government's position as to whether this court should take an inspiration in those principles as identified by the ICJ? And that concerns the relationship between international humanitarian law and human rights law. That's the first question. The second question, if the government would be so kind to point out in terms of Geneva Convention No. 3 and in terms of Article 4, the groups of combatants, to which group would you attribute Mr. Hassan exactly? Then as concerns the release, exactly the facts surrounding a release of Mr. Hassan, would you explain these discrepancies in various records? We indeed have several dates, 2nd May, 12 May, 17 May. How does it happen that there is no \u2013 one clear record on the release? How does it happen that it is still uncertain which drop-off point exactly was he \u2013 well, dropped off? And do you consider that this lack of precision in the records is compatible with the principle under Geneva Convention No. 4, which requires to provide for safe release of civilians if Mr. Hassan is to be presumed a civilian? And finally, a small question. You are also aware that under Article 106 in Geneva Convention No. 4, there is an obligation to have the internees to make them contact their family, and there is also an information that, well, an independent body such as ICRC is informed of the presence of the particular internee. Could you provide the Court with an information what happened exactly in the case of Mr. Hassan in terms of contacts with the outside world, the outside institution? Thank you very much.",
        "612": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have three questions. First of all, two questions on the fact that are addressed to the government. Number one question, the government have informed the court that the military order in force at the relevant time called for a two-stage screening process for prisoners claiming to be innocent civilians with an initial interview to determine civilian status, and then a second interview to determine whether there were grounds to suspect that the person concerned was a security risk or a criminal risk. Well, did the two interviews carried out in respect of Tarek Hassan correspond to this two-stage process? Was it normal practice for one interview to be carried out by United States agents and one interview by the second one by United Kingdom agents? And if not, why did this take place in Tarek Hassan's case? The second question on the facts is, was Tarek Hassan detained in a compound specifically set aside for United Kingdom detainees at any stage while he was at Camp Bucca? Third question I have is a question on the law, and it is addressed to both parties. The question is, do the terms of Article 15 of the convention allow a state to derogate from its obligations under Article 5 in the context of an international armed conflict, such as the military intervention in Iraq? And would it be necessary for a state formally to lodge such a derogation in order for the court to interpret Article 5, so as to take account of the context and also of the applicable norms of international humanitarian law? Thank you, Mr. President. Those are my three questions.",
        "613": "Thank you. Only one question to the government concerning the circumstances of the release of Mr. Tarek Hassan on some date on the month of May of 2003. I see that in the observations of the government in page 15, the government concerning the place of release gives two alternatives, either Umm Qasr or Basrah. Well, there is some difference because Umm Qasr was the home of Mr. Tarek Hassan, it's two and a half kilometers from Camp Bucca, and Basrah is 50 kilometers north, a dangerous place. Would it be possible for the government to maybe to ask some additional clarification of where was it released, in which one of these two places, or give some brief accounting of what was the usual proceeding for release? I mean, where the prisoners were transferred to Iraqi authorities, or where they transferred to some ONG or the Red Cross, or where they just left in some village or some highway. I think that could be interesting information. Thank you.",
        "614": "Thank you. I would also just have one question about concrete detail. The applicants submit that Tarek Hassan was found, his body, his dead body was found, and he still had the ID, the UK ID tag in his pocket. So what was the practice of the British forces with ID tags as soon as they released prisoners? Were the ID tag usually taken away? What was done with a United States ID tag? What was the practice there? Thank you.",
        "615": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question is addressed to the applicant. What does the applicant think about Baroness Hale's remark in Al-Jedda that international humanitarian law does not displace international human rights law, but it qualifies international human rights law, in the sense that restrictions to the European Convention rights can be applied that are not foreseen in the European Convention? And insofar, the courts, these courts, we need is limited to control of the exercise of proportionality in the application of these rights. And my second question, also addressed to the applicant, is about to remark that the civilian was used as a bargaining chip, a bargaining instrument. I would like you to elaborate a little bit further on this topic. What is, in substance, the evidence that you can produce before us to sustain this statement? Thank you.",
        "616": "President, I have three questions, the first of them to Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to Serbia, Serbia and Slovenia referred to the 1997 act by which Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I quote, effectively acknowledged its liability for the contested savings, thereby creating a reasonable expectation on the part of the savers that they would recover their savings. Could you please comment on this legislation? To the Serbian government, Bosnia and Herzegovina referred to the 1998 Foreign Currency Savings Act and to the 2002 Public Debt Act, supporting, according to Bosnia, the position that by those two acts, you interfered with the savings of the applicants. Could you please elaborate on those acts? And finally, my third question goes to Slovenia. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia referred to a series of judgments by Slovenian courts, including the Supreme Court of Slovenia, ruling in substance in favor of the applicants' legal positions. Could you please comment on those judgments? Thank you very much, Mr. President.",
        "617": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a general question to all of the respondent states, with the exception of Macedonia. I note in our file and also as just explained by the Macedonian agent, that there was a possibility to acknowledge the liability over the deposits made in the territory of, in this case, Macedonia with the Macedonian banks. So the point of departure to my question to the other respondents is, given the example of one of the respondent states, would you sum up in a nutshell why in relation to the others, probably to a lesser degree, I would say, Croatia, why in relation to the other respondent states this was not considered and was not a possibility? And there I go back to Judge Sicilianos question in relation to Bosnia-Herzegovina, why there was a retraction of what seemed to be the earlier position similar to that to Republic of Macedonia. Thank you.",
        "618": "Yes, thank you. I would have three questions, two questions to all the governments and one question to Bosnia-Herzegovina. So the question to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be, is it true that in 1993 LB Sarajevo was registered in the company registry and that it was mentioned that the assets, rights and obligations of the LB main branch Sarajevo as the legal predecessor passed over to Ljubljana's Banka Sarajevo as the legal successor? Was it true and what was the meaning of this registration? And then to all the governments, for me it's still unclear when, by whom and with which explanation the decision was taken to freeze the accounts and what was exactly meant legally speaking by freezing. And the last question to all the governments, what were the necessary and at the same time the sufficient conditions respectively for your governments to restart negotiations and to bring them to a result acceptable by all? Thank you.",
        "619": "One is going to the government of Slovenia, but if others know, they might help. We heard about the Constitutional Act of 1994 and that the assets were transferred from the old Ljubljanska Banka to new Ljubljanska Banka. I assume it must be known how much of the assets were transferred. So this is one question. And the other question is related as well to the negotiations and NXC. Could you explain how do you understand what is the matter of negotiations according to the NXC? Thank you.",
        "620": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. J'ai juste une question au gouvernement et aussi une question au requ\u00e9rant. Juste d'abord au gouvernement, \u00e0 partir de quelle date l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o effectu\u00e9 le 13 juin 1990 au sous-sol du b\u00e2timent de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision publique a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 au dossier de l'enqu\u00eate? C'est pour le gouvernement. Et je voudrais demander aussi au requ\u00e9rant, c'est toujours \u00e7a concerne moment, \u00e0 partir de quel moment M. Stoika s'est rendu compte que l'enqu\u00eate n'\u00e9tait pas effective? Merci.",
        "621": "Thank you, Mr. President. Very short question for government. You have mentioned that there had now been a climate of impunity concerning these events in Romania in the 1990s. Can you answer that? How many persons had been finally convicted for the violation of human rights during this period? Thank you.",
        "622": "Thank you, Mr. President. My question goes to the government. We have heard today that the government thinks that the time limit of prescription expired before the complaint was lodged. And today it offered us two dates, June 1995 and June 1998. In the government's observations of July 2013, only one of these dates was presented, June 1995. My question is, what is the final position of the government? Is it the one presented today to us, which sets the deadline of prescription in June 1998, or is it June 1995? I'm a little bit puzzled by these two dates. In any case, the government also proposed or reserved the right in those submissions that I have referred to, the right to present to the Court examples of relevant case law following this interpretation. Where are they? Where are these cases? What are these precedents to sustain, to support the position of the government, the interpretation given to us by the government? And finally, if so, if the delay of prescription was already expired, can the government provide any explanation for the fact that the public prosecutor accepted the complaint in 2001 and went on and on with the investigation for many years? Is there any explanation to the fact that the public prosecutor did not find the complaint time-barred in 2001? Thank you.",
        "623": "Thank you. Questions to both parties. When exactly in time was the plea bargaining initiated? And second, who did initiate the friendly settlement negotiations with the prosecutor's office? Was it applicant's daughter, the applicant themselves, or the representatives of the prosecutor's office? Now question to the applicant. What is the applicant's explanation for the fact that the plea agreement had not been offered to the first applicant during the first four months of his detention in the same cell as the persons charged with his kidnapping in 2004, and another person serving a sentence for murder? And why did he decide to accept it only two months after his transfer to another cell? And now question to the government. What was the significance of the fact, if any, that the transfer of the factory shares and of the monetary payments had occurred before the procedural agreement was reached? Thank you.",
        "624": "Thank you. Thank you, President. I have some questions for the government and for the applicants, too. My first question is for the government. According to the Article 6793, second part point E of the Georgian Code of Criminal Procedure, before approving a procedural agreement, the court must ensure that the accused understands that he has constitutional rights, the right to a defense, the right to refuse to enter into agreement stating his admission of guilt, and the right to have the merits of his case examined. Could you explain whether the applicants mentioned rights, particularly the right to have the merits of his case examined? Was followed, whether there was examination of the merits of the case? And the second, the right to refuse to enter into agreement. As we can see from this provision of law, it is just in case of admission of guilt, so-called church bargain. What in case of sentence bargain, which was the case in the applicant's case, whether he could refuse entering into the agreement for the sentence bargain? This is the one question. And the second question relates to Article 34. My colleague already raised the question before getting these shares. In the mail exchange between the applicant's daughter and the representative of the prosecutor's general office, the prosecution authority was ready to return partially the factory shares to the applicant's family. My question is whether it was ex-gratia returning, or it was some kind of admittance by the prosecution authority of the arbitrariness committing during the investigation. And the second question, which is from the same email exchange, that the prosecution authority stated that the prosecution could unilaterally annul the player bargain and declare the first applicant wanted. What it means, whether it means the reopening of the criminal proceeding or not, and what was the grounds in the law. And the last question for the applicant, does the applicant understand that the possible finding of a violation under Article 6.1 of the Convention might entail the reopening of the criminal proceedings, as was asked by the government. And in this case, is this something he really wishes and is ready for such a course of action for the opening of the criminal proceedings? Thank you.",
        "625": "Yes, please. The government has mentioned the recently published judgment of the Czech Constitutional Court. And actually, you said that it's more a procedural violation that was found. I just want to quote a small paragraph out of this judgment and ask the government to comment on it. I quote, a modern democratic state founded on the rule of law is based on the protection of individual and inalienable freedoms, the delimitation of which closely relates to human dignity. That freedom, which includes freedom to personal activities, is accompanied by a certain degree of acceptable risk. The right of parents to a free choice of place and mode of a delivery is limited only by the interest of safe delivery and health of the child. That interest cannot be, however, interpreted as an ambiguous preference for deliveries in hospital. So please, I would like to ask you to comment on this part of the judgment. And my second question would be also to the government. Are there any secondary aims of the legislation in protecting especially vulnerable women who might not be able to arrange safe birth at home properly? And in this regard, I would also like to know from the applicants why they emphasized that the women were highly educated. So is there a risk for women who are not that highly educated? And my last question would concern the statistics. The expert of the government has mentioned the risks that can occur, even if there was no risk visible in advance. So I would like to know, if you have any data, how often a normal birth has to be interrupted and the mother or the child given emergency aid in cases where no such risk was visible before. Thank you.",
        "626": "Thank you. We heard evidence today from the government, from an expert obstetrician, gynecologist, and I would be interested in hearing the applicant's response to the evidence that was produced today. The evidence was, if I understood it correctly, that at times an unanticipated risk can occur, such as an abruption during pregnancy, which requires delivery of the baby within minutes, if I understood correctly. For example, I think the example given was where there was a lack of oxygen to the baby, and perhaps in circumstances a baby may need to be delivered by a caesarean section. I would be interested in hearing the applicant's response to such evidence through the prism of a question, how would the best interests of the child be weighed in circumstances where such an emergency occurred, even where midwifery or medical care had been afforded by a state, but where such care was inadequate because, for example, it would take too long to get the baby to a hospital, the baby could suffer, I think it was either catastrophic or devastating consequences, if delivery was not effected within minutes. Thank you. How would the best interests of the child be served in the balance in those circumstances?",
        "627": "Thank you, Mr. President. Actually, I would like to continue somewhat on that question, but then more a question to the government, also focusing on the public interest that it is invoking. And I indeed heard Mr. Velebil referring to the need for urgent action in life-threatening situations. But my question is, having regard to that aim of the legislation, which arguably is a very legitimate one, why then does the law not go so far as to prohibit altogether deliveries at home? Why are mothers still allowed to give birth at home? And in the present situation, that means allowed and obliged to give birth at home in an unassistant way. In other words, why doesn't the state bring its reasoning to its logical end? Why does it stop somewhere before getting to that point?",
        "628": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma question est dirig\u00e9e vers le gouvernement. Je comprends bien s\u00fbr toute l'importance que repr\u00e9sente l'objectif de la sant\u00e9 de l'enfant. Le gouvernement a choisi la voie d'une prohibition indirecte, mais presque absolue. Certains Etats, \u00e0 l'inverse, ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la r\u00e9gulation \u00e0 la prohibition. Cela signifie concr\u00e8tement qu'ils ont \u00e9tabli une liste de conditions mat\u00e9rielles et m\u00e9dicales pour autoriser l'accouchement \u00e0 domicile. Quelles observations le gouvernement fait-il \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de tel syst\u00e8me de r\u00e9gulation, d'une part au regard de l'objectif de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'enfant, de la sant\u00e9 de l'enfant, et d'autre part au regard du principe de proportionnalit\u00e9?",
        "629": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have some questions to both parties. And to the applicant. First, as a clarification of the facts and this question, since the applicant herself raised this aspect. When the applicant filled the application for confirmation of gender, the requirements were not fulfilled, since there was not the consent of the spouse. And my question is, did the spouse object to the legal recognition of the current gender of the applicant? My second question is the following, and this again, since the applicant herself raised this question. It's quite true that there are certain differences between marriage and same-sex partnership in Finland. The establishment of paternity on the basis of marriage, adoption right outside the family, and name of the spouse. And my question is, would these differences have any practical effect to the applicant's life, taking into account, for example, that there is age limit for adoption outside the family for everyone, and the applicant's child was born in wedlock, and the parenthood and paternity does not change if the marriage is converted to same-sex partnership. And my last third question to the applicant concerns the statistical information she refers to. The applicant in her referral requested to the Grand Chamber refers to the Rainbow Index, and that in that was said that 24 states transgender persons are permitted to remain married. My question is, what is the basis for this interpretation? Does it base on the idea that the states where there are no regulations at all for this situation have permitted same-sex marriages? And then I have two questions to the government. My question is, what effect does the turning marriage into same-sex partnership have in the population register to the child born in wedlock, born in marriage? Does it change something in his or her information in the population register? Will it mean that he or she is born out of wedlock, or if not born out of wedlock, will there be some other change in his or her status in that respect? And then I have a bit hypothetical question. Since same-sex marriages are permitted in the other Nordic states, and it might be quite possible that the same-sex marriage couple might move permanently to Finland, where same-sex marriages are not possible, how would they be registered into the population register? As a married couple or as a same-sex partnership? Thank you.",
        "630": "Thank you, Mr. President. May I ask the applicants two facts-related questions? First, there was reference to religious convictions, and I would like to know whether they contracted a religious marriage, and if so, when. And secondly, I see in the various applications and observations references to certain disadvantages of the current status. And I would like to have more information on this. I understand that you cannot change the number as long as you are married. I still have difficulties understanding the specific consequences. You referred to a travel card and also a passport problem. Is there no way to solve this problem? Is there no way to put in the passport the gender you would like to have maintaining the number? And are there any other consequences of the current status that are not mentioned here? Thank you.",
        "631": "Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to ask a small question about Article 14. We have heard and we could read a lot about an argument of the applicant stating that there is here an unequal treatment of persons in relevantly similar situations. The applicant says that there are similar situations. The government denies that there are similar situations to make a comparison. But in the observations of the applicant, and more specifically in paragraph 60 of the observations, it is also said that the two situations are sufficiently different in order to justify distinct regulation. I would like to ask the applicant to explain what is meant by this, because suddenly we have here different situations. Which situations could be meant here? And could we also have the government views on this? Thank you.",
        "632": "Thank you, President. I would wish to put a question to both parties. It concerns the per diem allowance. I would like to know more about the nature and the purpose of the per diem allowances paid to soldiers, reservists, in the Serb army. Are the per diem allowances of a salarial nature, or are they intended more as a compensation? And if so, a compensation for what? Thank you.",
        "633": "Thank you, Mr. President. As a clarifying question, I put the question to the both parties. What is actually the legal basis for the requested per diem? Is it the rules on travel and other expenses in the Yugoslav army and decision adopted by the chief of staff of the Yugoslav army? Or is it the agreement which was concluded in 11th January 2008? So that's my question. And if the answer is that they are both, so which was the legal basis for the agreement? Were these two rules? As a clarification, thank you. Thank you.",
        "634": "Thank you, Mr. President. To follow up on Judge Hirvel\u00e4's questions, we heard also now in the submissions, especially of the government, if the applicants could try systematically to answer to the following questions. First, are you maintaining that the per diems in 1999 were not paid to you? Why, if they were not paid at that time, why did you choose to go to the first instance court only in 2008? Thirdly, are you saying that 2008 agreement recognized that debt in payment of the per diems, or are you saying that this is a new or additional financial aid to which you should also be entitled to? And a sort of a small question, do you actually agree that the municipalities that are part of the agreement are of a particular need in financial aid, are indeed those that are particularly poor in Serbia? Thank you.",
        "635": "Thank you, Mr. President. First, I have a question to the applicants. Could the applicants specify the number of days spent in the army during the critical period, that is for each and every one of them? And I have a question to the government and another one which occurred to me during the oral hearing. The first question is, could the government provide evidence on the exact dates and amounts of the transfers from the state budget to the municipalities enumerated in the agreement of January 2008? And the second question is, and I'm provoked by the intervention of the government agent because he put forward the idea of providing adequate solutions from the government to the reservists. May I kindly ask the government agent to specify what way and manner would they be satisfied and what sort of solution is envisaged by the government? Thank you.",
        "636": "Thank you, Mr. President. One question addressed to the Council for the Government. In the statistics you supplied with your letter, which the Government submitted with its letter of the 27th August 2013, there was a table indicating, among others, the incidents occurring in courtrooms as such. And there were incidents of a number of escapes from courthouses, a number of attacks on court staff, and a number of incidents of self-mutilation in courthouses for the period 2009-2013, which for the courthouse incidents, the figures are 4, 14, 20, 16, and 18. Could the Council for the Government explain these incidents in the courthouse? What is meant by self-mutilation? Could you give some examples of what is meant here by incidents of self-mutilation in the courthouse? And I refer to the figures, I repeat, 4, 14, 20, 16, and 18. Thank you.",
        "637": "Merci, M. le Pr\u00e9sident. Ma premi\u00e8re question s'adresse aux repr\u00e9sentants de la requ\u00e9rante. Au point 143 de vos observations finales, vous traitez de la question de la proportionnalit\u00e9 de la mesure d'interdiction que vous contestez. Vous \u00e9crivez notamment le gouvernement d\u00e9fendeur aurait pu adopter des mesures moins g\u00eanantes plut\u00f4t que de poursuivre celles qui portent le voile int\u00e9gral en public. Pourriez-vous indiquer \u00e0 la Cour de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise des exemples concrets de mesures moins restrictives que l'interdiction, qui, selon vous, auraient permis au gouvernement de parvenir aux objectifs qu'il estime l\u00e9gitimes? Mes questions suivantes s'adressent maintenant \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentante du gouvernement. Le second paragraphe de l'article 9 \u00e9nonce les buts l\u00e9gitimes qui seuls permettent d'apporter une restriction \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de religion. \u00c0 ce titre, le gouvernement invoque quatre objectifs l\u00e9gitimes. La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, les exigences minimales de la vie en soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre hommes et femmes et la dignit\u00e9 de la personne. Je souhaiterais vous poser quelques br\u00e8ves questions sur ces objectifs. S'agissant tout d'abord de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, est-ce qu'une mesure d'interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur l'ensemble de l'espace public ne pose pas un probl\u00e8me de respect de la proportionnalit\u00e9 au regard de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique? Vous nous avez indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre que le Conseil constitutionnel et la Cour de cassation avaient surmont\u00e9 cette difficult\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, je remarque que dans l'\u00e9tude qu'il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande du Premier ministre, le Conseil d'\u00c9tat y a vu au contraire une difficult\u00e9 pour respecter la proportionnalit\u00e9. Pour les trois autres objectifs ensuite, c'est-\u00e0-dire les exigences minimales de la vie en soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre hommes et femmes et la dignit\u00e9 de la personne, s'agissant d'objectifs l\u00e9gitimes sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, objectifs l\u00e9gitimes selon le terme que vous employez et non pas de buts l\u00e9gitimes comme le prescrit le second paragraphe de l'article 9, pourriez-vous indiquer \u00e0 la Cour \u00e0 quel but l\u00e9gitime chacun de ces objectifs l\u00e9gitimes se rattache? Ensuite, concernant l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre hommes et femmes, est-ce qu'il n'y a pas une difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 opposer ce principe d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre hommes et femmes \u00e0 des femmes qui revendiquent la pratique interdite comme un droit? Enfin, s'agissant de la dignit\u00e9 de la personne, \u00e0 ce titre, vous \u00e9crivez dans vos observations, je cite, que l'on se place du point de vue de la femme dont le visage est dissimul\u00e9 ou de l'interlocuteur, il y a une atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la femme. Cette phrase suscite deux interrogations pour moi. Premi\u00e8re interrogation, est-ce que c'est \u00e0 l'\u00c9tat de d\u00e9cider qu'un comportement librement choisi est contraire \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de celui ou de celle qu'il adopte? Et seconde interrogation, en quoi la dignit\u00e9 de ceux qui rencontrent une femme portant le voile int\u00e9gral est-elle menac\u00e9e? Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident.",
        "638": "My first question goes to both parties, and it relates to the fact that it follows from the documents in this case, and in particular, those who describe the original behavior of the applicant, that she has not always been consistent as regards the use of the bird cup. And we have heard that the parties disagree as to whether she's a victim or whether she's not a victim for that reason. We are aware of that issue. Now the question relates to both parties concerning the merits of the case. This arguable, inconsistent manifestation of faith, could that have a bearing on the balancing of interests under Article 9, Paragraph 2 of the Convention? That was the first question to both parties. Now I have two questions only to the government. And the first question supplements Judge Potocki's, one of his questions. And it relates particularly to the aims involved under Article 9.2, which the government has referred to. And my question relates particularly to the alternative, the aim called the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Could I kindly ask the government to elaborate a bit more on the applicability of that particular aim in relation to one of the stated purposes of the French Act, namely the social cohesion or the vivre ensemble problem? So that was the first question. The second question also, as I said, goes to the government. And that is something which has maybe not been so much focused on orderly. But it is about the tension or the episodes that we know from the documents have arisen in connection with concrete police control concerning the enforcement of the Act in connection with the full veil being, women being approached in the street wearing the full veil. Now this kind of tension, these kind of episodes may arguably indicate that the Act contributes to tension instead of social cohesion. Is this a problem in relation to Article 9.2 concerning the requirement that the purpose of the Act must be based on relevant and sufficient reasons? Thank you.",
        "639": "Merci, Monsieur le Pr\u00e9sident. Je n'ai qu'une question. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la requ\u00e9rante explique ce qu'elle appelle \u00ab compromise proposals \u00bb. Je cite, elle dit, \u00ab Firstly, I would be willing to accept restrictions regarding the visibility of the veils material. It has to wear only veils that were diaphanous see-through, thus ensuring that my facial features remained essentially visible. \u00bb Et dans la circulaire de mars 2011, on dit, on explique, \u00ab Les tenues destin\u00e9es \u00e0 dissimuler le visage sont celles qui rendent impossible l'identification de la personne. \u00bb Alors, ma question est la suivante. Est-ce qu'un tel comportement, comme propos\u00e9 par la requ\u00e9rante, tomberait sous l'interdiction de la loi? Merci. Merci.",
        "640": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. And the first question could go to both parties. It stems from some of the statements in your both written and oral submissions. I would be very happy if you could clarify whether, in your view, a psychological violence was committed by the very fact that the girl, at the time, discovered that her intimate privacy, human dignity, if you will, might have been breached by the stepfather and the actual fact that the camera was found. So it's really, I would like your views on whether you consider that was, at that moment, an act of psychological violence. And my second question goes more to the government, but if the applicant have something to add, I think that would be appreciated. In view of the particular vulnerability of children against all types of violence, and I think we are in the presence not simply of the two private person relationship, but we are in the presence of a child, and the basic principle of human rights law that all decisions and actions of the authorities should have the best interests of the child in mind, could the government point out in what manner were the steps that you have just described, as taken following the complaints from the applicant, effective for the protection of a child, in a sense of both preventing that such acts occur in the future, and in a sense of giving some element of rehabilitation? Thank you.",
        "641": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have also two questions. The first goes to the government. Mr. R\u00f6nquist, if I got you right, you said that the gravity of the act by the stepfather was not such as to create a positive obligation of the state to criminalize it. And then you elaborated on the notion of significant flaws. May we take it that there was, in fact, a flaw in criminal law at the time of the acts, but that such flaw was not significant according to the government? Is this assumption a correct one or not? And the second question goes to the applicant, especially to Mr. Lewis. Since the time of the acts, there have been legislative changes and proposals for new criminal legislation. Do you think that the flaw you have referred to has been covered by legislation actually in force? Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.",
        "642": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions to both parties. The government argue that the child pornography offense was applicable, at least in theory, to the facts. Assuming that this position is correct, why didn't the Court of Appeal use the provision of Chapter 30, Section 3 of the Code of Judicial Procedure and change the legal characterization of the criminal offense into this one? First question. Second question. According to Chapter 22, Section 7 of the Code of Judicial Procedure, the court can award compensation to non-pecuniary damages, even in the case of acquittal of the defendant. My question is, why the Court of Appeal did not use these Chapter 22, Section 7 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure? And adding to that, if the government accept the view of the Supreme Court that there is no civil liability based directly on the convention, directly on provisions of the convention, when there are no other violations of domestic law? And I quote, from the decision of the Supreme Court of October 2007, an individual could not be obliged to compensate another individual directly on the basis of the convention. Does the government support this view? And as this view, this legal interpretation of national law object to the fulfillment of the positive obligations of the respondent state in this particular case. Thank you.",
        "643": "Thank you Mr. President. I have also two questions. The first one is sort of in the framework of comparative law because many countries in Central Europe at least and in France as well have something which is called personality rights. \"Pers\u00f6nlichkeit Richten\" in German, \"le droit de personalit\u00e9\" in French. And by that kind of civil law standard, the right to one's own image would have been the minimum civil law tort claim which had been, the right which had been violated in this kind of situation without regard to any pornography aspect of the story. In other words, in some countries, if even in the public you are being photographed without your consent, unless you are a public figure, that might be a problem. And you cite of course, von Hanover, second grand chamber judgment in which a similar situation has occurred in this respect. And therefore my question is, does Sweden have this kind of personality rights tradition or registration in the context of the traditional tort law? My second question to the government is as follows. We are here talking about the rights of the applicant, but it is easy to imagine if we turn this situation like a glove inside out, that we might be dealing with a situation in which the perpetrator, the stepfather of the applicant here, would have been the claimant here, would have been the appellant here, applicant here. In other words, in that situation, if he had been convicted, he would have asked the reverse question because it would fall under article seven and it would be a question of whether the legality principle was or was not violated in this situation. Therefore, I know this is a speculative question, but to me it provides the mirror image of the situation. I'd be very grateful if the government could take the position on that kind of a question. Thank you.",
        "644": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to ask two questions to the government. And the first question relates to the current situation of the applicant. The applicant, we know what her situation is with respect to the remission of her sentence. But I would like to know what the situation now is with respect to the days that she has worked. Do they have any effect on the duration of her sentence? Could that play a role with respect to a conditional release or in any other way? That's my first question. And the second question is about the point that was raised by you just at the end of your oral argument. If the judgment of the chamber would be confirmed by the grand chamber, what would be the concrete effects, not only for the applicant, but also for other prisoners currently detained in Spain? How many prisoners are affected? And what would be the effect, the concrete effect? Thank you.",
        "645": "Thank you. My question is first mostly to the government. Who was the legal representative, if any, of Mr. C\u00e2mpeanu? Or in other words, did Mr. C\u00e2mpeanu have any legal representative? And in that case, who was the representative? And the other question is for the applicant, concerning the events of the 20th February 2004, I mean the last day of the life of Mr. C\u00e2mpeanu. It seemed that, well, he was still alive. A team of monitors of the CLR visited the Poiana Mare Hospital. They saw directly Mr. C\u00e2mpeanu. They assessed his situation. And then they requested for him to be translated to another hospital. And the request was rejected. And it seems that this team made a report on the facts. Now, my question is possible at this time, so many years ago. First, did the centre have some previous knowledge of the situation of Mr. C\u00e2mpeanu? Or what was the reason for the visit to the hospital? Secondly, did the team then, after seeing Mr. C\u00e2mpeanu's situation, have a direct interview with the manager of the hospital? In this case, did they have a direct answer to their request? Or was it just that the manager did not take any decision? So, if possible, what were the terms of the relation of this team with the manager of the CLR, I mean of the hospital? Thank you.",
        "646": "Thank you, Mr President. I have a question to the Government. The representatives of the respondent state have referred to the mission of the Court under Article 34 of the Convention. They have underlined the meaning of the victim concept and its restrictions when it comes to admissibility. There is, however, another element in Article 34 to which I want to draw attention. Article 34 of the Convention on the Right of Individual Applications' last sentence reads, The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right. My question to the Government is related to that last sentence in particular, having in mind that there is little room between the act and the omission. The Government acknowledge the fact that Mr C\u00e2mpeanu was a particularly vulnerable person, that he was an orphan and that he had no legal guardian appointed when he turned 18. The Government note in their submissions that the CLR had the possibility to ask the domestic courts the lifting of Mr C\u00e2mpeanu's legal capacity and to ask for the nomination of a tutor pursuant to Articles 143 and 115 of the Code of Family. How could the Centre have done so before having even monitored his existence? Why should the State, on its own motion, not have taken the proper initiative to the appointment of a legal representative in order to secure that the vulnerable Mr C\u00e2mpeanu, who was confined and confronted with major decision-making concerning his health, would have had effective access to justice? In close connection to this, the matter can be raised whether a State that fails to provide proper representation to vulnerable persons in a situation like Mr C\u00e2mpeanu's thereby in any way hinders the effective exercise of the right to bring an application to our Court. Such hindrance may perhaps run against the obligation in Article 34, the last sentence. Does the Government hold a view on this matter? Thank you.",
        "647": "Thank you, President. My question follows those of judges L\u00f3pez Guerra and Silvis and concern the applicant's representation. Had the applicant so wanted during his lifetime, could he in fact and in effect have obtained representation to defend his interests before domestic authorities and this court? For example, could he during his lifetime in fact and in effect have obtained representation to file the complaints which the Center for Legal Resources is today raising before us? Thank you.",
        "648": "Thank you very much, Mr. President. I do have two questions, one to the government and one to the applicant. Both are focusing on procedural aspect of the case. First question to the government. We do have in our materials information that in its decision of 15th of June 2006 concerning a criminal complaint lodged by the same NGO, CLR, on behalf of another patient, PC, that had died at the same hospital, PM Hospital, the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed the prosecutor's objection on the lack of standing of the same NGO. In its reasoning, the High Court held that the CLR did have local standing to pursue such proceedings deemed to elucidate the circumstances in which 17 patients had died at the same hospital in between January and February 2004. The question is, what is the difference between today's case and the case of PC where the High Court of Cassation and Justice recognized local standing? The second question is to the applicant. And it concerns the exhaustion of domestic remedies. In our case, in today's case, the prosecutor's office attached to the Calafa District Court appealed against the judgment. On 4th of April 2008, the Dole County Court allowed the appeal, annulled the judgment delivered by the Calafa District Court, and rejected the complaint lodged by CLR. Now, the court mainly relies on the conclusions of the forensic report and the autopsy report, as well as on the decision of the Doctors Association, and simply rejected it because there was no casual link between the medical treatment given by Mr. C\u00e2mpeanu and his death. My question is procedural. Why, in this case, CLR didn't go to the High Court of Cassation and Justice like CLR did in the case of PC? Thank you very much.",
        "649": "Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the applicant's representatives. If I understand well from the case file, at the domestic level, you're recognized as legal representatives of Mr. C\u00e2mpeanu. And today, before us, you are claiming to be recognized as indirect victims on the case. Could you explain to me the change on your position, why you claim today to be recognized as indirect victims, especially bearing in mind the Nancella case that you mentioned as well? Thank you.",
        "650": "Thank you, Mr. President. The government did not address the merits of the case. Thus, the silence of the government should be read as an acknowledgment of the violations imputed regarding Articles 2, 3, 5, and 8, leaving aside, of course, the question of admissibility of complaint. This is a question addressed to the government, of course. Thank you."
